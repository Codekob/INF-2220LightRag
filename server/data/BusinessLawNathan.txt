Introduction
Business Law is not in the Anglo-American
system a clearly separable layer of law. It is made
up of any and all propositions from every part
of the constitutions, statutes and decisionsto
which must be added administrative orders and
decrees and legally recognizable customsthat
may be pertinent to any business situation. And
as the term business itself is rather expansive,
we may start with the assumption that no proposition in the law books can be dogmatically ruled
out of the scope of business law. For convenience, however, we may recognize at once certain divisions of the law as more or less likely to
be involved in the everyday pursuits connected
with earning a livelihood. We may thus set aside
as beyond the scope of this volume the whole
of public law (Vol. III), of criminal law (Vol. II), of
family law (Vol. VI, Part II), of property law (Vol.
V), and even much of torts and contracts (Vol.
VI, Part I). There remains a good deal of the law
of contracts, particularly the contracts of buyer
and seller, of employer and employee, of borrower and lender, of insurer and insured, of carrier and passenger or shipper, of the parties to
negotiable paper and of the members of a business organization. There remains, too, a great
deal that is not simply contractual in the sense
of being based on consent, but, rather, is dictated by authority, about the conditions of the
market, about credit, about business organization.
Many of these matters are covered by separate commercial codes in countries where the
law is codified. Hence on the continent of Europe the courts, courses, books and periodicals
devoted to Commercial Law have artificial
boundaries within which prominent places are
occupied by the law of Negotiable Instruments,
Partnership and Corporations, and a great deal
of ingenuity is developed in distinguishing between the transactions and persons that fall
within the purview of the commercial code and
those which are to be judged by the general
code.
It is no mere accident that the Anglo-American system insists that all persons are governed
by one law, whether they be merchants or not.
That matter was fought out in England in the
seventeenth century. Prior to that time the Kings
Courts had taken little notice of the disputes of
merchants. They were handled in petty special
courts, such as the Court of the Fairs. In the

www.suspicions.info

early seventeenth century Lord Coke, Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, by his decisions, his
writing; and his political activity, succeeded in
reducing these petty courts to insignificance and
in transferring their jurisdiction to the Kings
Courts, and reducing their laws to recognizable customs. As late as 1622 Gerard Malynes
informs us that these customs apply only to
merchants. A gentleman cannot be a party to
commercial paper. But before the end of the
century the courts are telling us that whoever
signs such paper becomes ad hoc a trader.1 Between these two views lie several generations
during which Englishmen are superseding foreigners as merchants. So the Courts Merchant
are suppressed, but the law merchant becomes
part of the law of the land for everybody, and
merchants are subject to the fused law of which
their old customs are but a part.
This rule of one law for all was quite acceptable in the eighteenth century, particularly on
this side of the Atlantic where it fitted well not
only with political prejudices but also with social and economic facts. In pioneer life,
When Adam dolve, and Eve span,
Who was then the gentleman?

Likewise, who was the artisan, who the
trader, who the farmer and who the professional
man? Obviously, the division of persons into
such classes for legal purposes would not have
corresponded to the facts of life. So the doctrine of the equality of all men was written into
our fundamental law. Our constitutions have
condemned as class legislation all attempts to
deal with one occupation in a special way unless they showed the clearest justification or,
better still, were phrased in generalizations
which negatived discrimination even while they
singled out instances on the basis of a recognizable principle.
Still, subtle influences were at work in the
nineteenth century to develop in our law a new
differentiation between traders and the general
public and among traders themselves. These influences operated principally through reading
implications into contracts. The person regularly
engaged in a business was understood to have
made certain representations to the public as
to his skill. It was one thing for a charwoman to
sew a dress inside out, and quite another for a
professional dressmaker to do so.2 It is one
thing for an iceman, who genially agrees to take
your trunk to the railroad station, to mishandle
it, and quite another for the regular expressman to do so.3 In recent years the difference

between the professional and the amateur in
business has been emphasized by statutes
statutes requiring licenses and sometimes examinations before one can hang out a shingle;
statutes pertaining to particular businesses, in
spite of their general terminology; statutes singling out particular businesses (in spite of the
constitutional prejudice in favor of generality),
either on the score of police power or the states
right to regulate public utilities and other businesses affected with a public interest, or because
of a peculiar opportunity of the state to bargain
through its power to withhold or give conditionally a charter or franchise or other privilege. It
is thus possible today, once more to speak not
only of a law of business in a narrow sense, but
also of the law of special businesses such as
banking, public utilities, stock brokerage, real
estate brokerage, retailing, chain stores, advertising, insurance, or even peddling, plumbing
or conducting a beauty parlor.
The scope of our present study is, of course,
broader. We include the activities of the market
place, the factory, the bank, the exchange, the
office, the directors room, the stockholders
meeting, and we even look into the court and
the public administrative office when these are
the situs of business transactions. Our order of
procedure will deviate somewhat from that usually pursued in books on business law. Instead
of enumerating what the law provides in the way
of rules, standards, principles and institutions
and leaving their application to business needs
to be dealt with as an afterthoughtthus beginning with an answer and seeking appropriate questionswe shall proceed to ask what are
the requirements of business and then turn to
the law to see what it has to offer for their satisfaction. This is, of course, the order of procedure in life, when the business man brings his
problem to the lawyer.4

Chapter I

Business Postulates
& the Law
in a shop with reasonable safety,
and although we occasionally
read of holdups showing the danger of such an assumption, we
go on making it. Why? Is it because of our faith in the habits
of mankind, or in the workings
of the legal system, or some doctrine of chance, or because of our
own recklessness, or a combination of all of these? The question
becomes infinitely more complicated if, for such elementary human interests as security from
holdups, we substitute the vast
network of relations that we call
the credit system, which is another of the postulates of modem
business.
Without going far into the
analysis of the basis of any one
of these expectations, we may
venture two propositions: first,
that the legal system of any given
time or place contributes heavily
to the fulfillment of our expectations; and second, that the legal
system is by no means alone in
this function. The first of these
propositions is, of course, generally taken for granted. It is our
purpose here not to prove it, but
to find out just how the law
comes to the aid of the business
world. The second proposition,
however, is very generally overlooked. Legal specialists talk oc-

casionally as if the sole deterrent
from crime in the world today
were criminal law.1 Little wonder, then, that the layman looks
to the law to accomplish singlehanded the greatest of wonders,
and in turn criticizes the law for
its failure to do that which he
gratuitously assumes, in the first
place, it can do. When anything
goes wrong he says: There
ought to be a law against this or
that. He expects a legislative fiat
to make men moral, to make men
sober, to make men efficient. We
must, therefore, emphasize the
limits of effective legal action.2
When it actually was necessary
to look behind every tree for a
possible Indian, the best code in
the world could not have done
away with that necessity any
more than we can today put an
end to war by such a simple device as declaring it unlawful. Yet
with the aid of law and a hundred other elements we have succeeded in reaching a measure of
internal peace and we may hope
to achieve a corresponding measure of world peace eventually.
The point is that law does not
and cannot work alone. The development of law is but a phase
of the development of civilization. And when we speak of the
part played by law in the satisfy-

1. Law,
a Development of Civilization
As we go about our daily
business we take a great deal for
granted. If we had to look behind
every tree, figuratively or literally,
for a lurking Indian, we could
hardly do the work of the modem
world. We assume a high degree
of safety; we assume a high degree of human trustworthiness;
we assume that those about us
will act in a reasonable and fairly
predictable manner; and the vast
majority of these assumptions
are well founded. At least, we are
not often disappointed.
If we analyze these expectations or postulates on which
modern business is based, we
find very readily that they are
simple only to the simple
minded. We discover that they
differ not only in different times
and places and among different
races of men, but that they are
by no means all equally safe assumptions nor are they founded
on identical or even similar
bases. In fact, the explanation of
even the simplest and most obvious of these assumptions,
upon analysis, becomes a hopelessly complex problem of the
social and natural sciences. We
take it for granted, for example,
that a man can expose his wares

7

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

ing of the postulates of business,
we must bear in mind that it does
not satisfy those postulates
single-handed or exclusively. It
is neither without allies nor without rivals.

8

2. Conditioning Forces
Nor is it without conditioning forces. Just as the business
activities of the world take for
granted certain conditions, including the cooperation of the
law, the law itself has certain
postulates. The current legal system assumes, for example, that
people take a certain amount of
initiative in turning the wheels
of justice and, on the other hand,
that they will restrain themselves
just so much from interfering
with this machinery. The system
must break down completely
and does occasionally even in
this countrynot only where initiative is lacking because of indifference or fear, but also where
masked mobs, or the parties to
a feud, or even willful juries
take justice into their own
hands. The law, furthermore, presupposes a certain degree of
ability to understand the lawit
has been found futile at several
stages of history to transfer a
highly developed code to a crude
people. A law that penalized lying to the very limit would hardly
work in a community of confirmed liars. Our primary concern, however, is not with what
a system of law must take for
grantedthough we cannot ignore the bearing of this question
on the laws limitationsbut
with what business expects and
demands from the law.
3. Limitations upon Law
for Business Ends
Furthermore, we must recognize that other aspects of our
life, besides the business aspect,
make demands upon the law. In
the main, these demands are fortunately not only consistent with
but identical with the demands

of the business world. Peace, fair
and honest dealings, and the enforcement of obligations, for example, might be demanded in
the name of society, organized
on its political side, just as
readily as by that same society
thought of as a business unit.
There are, of course, differences
of emphasis, occasional differences in the limitations set, and
even rare contradictions. Thus,
business if left to itself might
never have invented homestead
exemptions as a limitation to enforcement laws. It is conceivable,
but not quite probable, that the
enforcement of debts by means
of imprisonment might have
been abolished by the business
world as unprofitable in the long
run, without the aid of the
humanitarian considerations
that were perhaps uppermost in
the actual abolition of imprisonment for debt. So far, however,
as we find conflicting demands
made upon the law in the name
of human interests other than
business, we shall have to take
them into consideration as limitations upon the use of law for
business ends.
4. Enumeration
of Business Ends of Law
What, then, are these business ends? Or, to resume the formal question with which we began, what does the business
world demand or more or less
thoughtlessly expect of the law
today? It has been demonstrated
with abundant learning by Dean
Pound that the end of law,
viewed both practically and theoretically, has been developing
throughout the course of legal
history.3 The earliest end discernible was a mere attempt to
keep the peace. In later states we
encounter first the maintenance
of an actual status quo and later
the struggle for some ideal set
of relations known as equity or
justice or natural fights. Today
we are stressing a fourth type of

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

end, and emphasis is shifted to
the satisfaction of human wants
and particularly to the opportunity for development.
It must be remembered, however, that in all of these developments the earlier ends of the law
have by no means been abandoned as the later ones have
emerged. The maintenance of
peace, the security of acquisitions, the approximation of what
appears to society for the time
being as natural justice or fairness, stand side by side today
with the insuring of human opportunities for development and
advancement. If we would restate
these general ends of the law
more narrowly in terms of what
the business world seeks, we
should still have to enumerate as
major ends: (1) peace and effective enforcement; (2) security of
acquisitions; (3) fair conditions
in the market, and, in addition
to these, (4) the facilitation of
transactions. Of course, the
meaning of all the older terms
has developed very materially as
time has gone on. The peace of
the Anglo-Saxon world, such as
it was, would not suffice for the
needs of the modern business
world. Neither would the enforcement machinery of the Middle
Ages. The kinds of acquisitions
that may be deemed the subject
of legal protection have multiplied and are changing even today. Some of the most important
developments of the law of recent years are concerned with
the growing concept of fair conditions in the market. But in the
main, it is true that the principal
accomplishment of the last half
century in the realm of business
law has been the development of
facilities and positive opportunities for the specific transactions
that constitute business.
5. Development
of Ends of Law
All these accomplishments of
the law are so thoroughly and

6. Business Postulates
of Today
For the purpose of fitting
these postulates into the picture
of business as it is conducted
today, we might pursue the opposite order to that of their historical development and consider some characteristics of the
need today for (1) facilitation of
transactions, (2) fair market conditions, (3) security of acquisitions, and (4) effective enforcement and peace.
(1) FACILITATION OF TRANSACTIONS. Typical of the transactions for which we expect the

law to furnish ready frameworks
are those transactions that have
to do with the organization of the
business world. Business needs
not merely schemes for summarizing the relations existing between people within a particular
business enterprisesuch as
agency, partnership, corporation, or Massachusetts trust
but also those devices that bring
together cooperating parts of a
business, however separated
they may at first sight seem.
There is every gradation between
the hand-to-mouth buying of raw
materials by one plant from another, through more comprehensive contracts for seasons and
through leases, to the complete
control or even ownership of the
plant furnishing the raw materials. Likewise, on the distributing
side, a vast variety of relations
may exist between the producers and those engaged in the
various steps of marketing. For
all of these relations the law is
called upon to furnish a fitting
framework and under the pressure of American life the law is
just as likely to be called upon
for mass production of frameworks of a more or less standardized nature as our factories are
to give mass production of standardized machinery. Business
presents numerous novel problems of organization calling for
most ingenious massing of traditional devices. Thus, where living conditions in a great city produce vast buildings in which it
becomes desirable to sell individual apartments to families,
the organization of the business
side of the scheme may involve
incorporation with more or less
complicated adjustment of ratios
of control, ownership, return,
and risks which may not correspond exactly to the amount of
investment. It may involve further peculiar types of leases or
deeds or mortgages. The financing may involve mortgages and
trusteeship and the issuance of

www.suspicions.com

bonds or trust certificates in
combinations that had never
been thought of before.
The credit devices of the
modern world must also respond
very delicately to peculiar needs
in particular situations. There is
a constant problem, for example,
to strike a balance somewhere
between the safety of the loan
and the freedom of the business
to which the loan is made from
interference. In a general way,
where real security is used the
more possessory a credit device
is the simpler and safer it seems,
but at the same time the more
likely it is to interfere with the
use of things in the ordinary
course of business. The vast series of new problems connected
with the financing of installment
sales, of which the most prominent example, of course, has
been automobile financing, will
illustrate the type of call that is
made upon the law for new machinery or for new combinations
of the old machinery of credit.4
There is, of course, a vast
variety of more or less typical
transactions that make up the
bulk of everyday business. The
type of framework furnished for
them is perhaps best illustrated
in our statutes standardizing
contracts of sale, the contracts
involved in negotiable instruments, insurance contracts, employment contracts, and many
others, by stipulating what the
details shall be either in the absence of contrary stipulation or
any agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding.5 New varieties
of transactions are constantly
emerging for which new types of
contracts are required. Thus,
with the coming of new modes
of transportation, whether we
turn to the period of the introduction of the steam railroad or
that of the motor bus or that of
aviation, new types of receipts
and agreements, with new
apportionments of risks, become
recognized as standard in the

Suspicions News Magazine

readily taken for granted that it
is somewhat difficult for us to
realize that, in the Anglo-American system of law, one need go
back only a few hundred years
to reach a period in which the
kings courts were not interested
in the private disputes of citizens
so long as they did not affect the
kings revenue or the kings
peace. Of course, the allusion to
the kings revenue and the kings
peace as the formal basis for taking jurisdiction over private disputes and enforcing private
claims was for a long time a mere
pretense, a fiction of the law. But
the fact that such a fiction had
to be used at the beginning of
modem times should remind us
that, what we take for granted
today when we expect this or
that of the law, was by no means
taken for granted at all stages in
our legal history; that it is by no
means taken for granted in all
parts of the world today, at least
in the same way; and that we
cannot be sure that we have
reached the limit of possible demands to be made upon law in
the furnishing of aids for the conduct of business. We are, in other
words, dealing with a situation
that is constantly developing,
constantly being experimented
with, and not at all with a preordained system of natural law.

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

law. In general, the tendency of
business is to require devices for
the facilitationand constantly
for the greater facilitationof a
widening circle of business activities. And the law responds,
sometimes through the ingenuity of the lawyers in adapting and
combining the old legal devices,
but occasionally also, with the
aid of legislation, by the creation
of new devices.

10

(2) FAIR MARKET CONDITIONS. The market conditions
that the business world demands
of the law have undergone a complete transformation since the
days of Lord Coke. The picture
of the buyer before the eyes of
the law has ceased to be that of
a very cautious, designing sort
of person well able to take care
of himself. On the contrary, every effort is made by means of
the licensing of dealers and
manufacturers, by means of the
registration and inspection of
products, by blue sky laws, by
imposing penalties for misbranding, adulteration, and
fraudulent advertising, by safeguarding competition and condemning unfair methods of doing business, to make the market safe for purchasers. Let us
contrast the conditions in older
systems of law that looked rather
to the protection of the seller. In
Roman law, for example, there
developed the idea that a seller
could repudiate an extremely
bad bargain though there was no
corresponding provision for a
disillusioned buyer.6 Such law
was, of course, appropriate in a
comparatively non-commercial
society where the selling of
goods outside of the ordinary
course of business was a sign of
distress on the part of the more
or less unwilling and unfortunate
owner. The buyer was looked
upon as a wealthy person taking
advantage of the distress of his
neighbor, much as if he were
lending him money for usury.

This picture has changed completely. The buyer represents
today the average member of
society, while the seller is looked
upon as the party better able to
take care of himself. The development of the modern point of
view in recent times is illustrated
in the development of the law of
implied warranties of quality7 or
of title8 and the disappearance
to that extent of caveat emptor.
The particular details as to
which the public puts a buyer
under its protection are, of
course, constantly changing.
Today the danger is from misbranding, false advertising, inadequately described securities.
Yesterday the emphasis was
rather on the danger of lack of
skill in professional men, mechanics, and others who have
been subjected to licensing laws.
Tomorrow the dangers may be
different and the emphasis may
be shifted to prevent the abuse
of high-powered salesmanship
accompanied by intriguing
installment devices.
(3) SECURITY OF ACQUISITIONS. The idea of security of
acquisitions is, of course, one of
the most important and best developed in the law. It not only fills
the pages discussing real and
personal property, but it is the
motive behind much of the criminal law, the tort law, the family
law and the constitutional law of
this country. In fact, the law is
frequently taunted with the
charge of setting property
rights above human rights.
What is really meant is the setting out more clearly of rights in
tangible things than rights that
seem to have less and less to do
with tangible things. Medieval
law was so limited in its property
concepts that it could not conceive of transferring such in-corporeal rights as the power of appointment to a church office
without some such act as handing over the knob of the church

door. But as time has gone on,
the law has progressively overcome this dread of intangibles
and within the field of business
has accorded the treatment formerly reserved for rights in
physical things to such new
types of property as goodwill,
patents, trade-marks, trade
name, copyright, going-concern
value, business reputation, interest in existing contracts, expectancies of various kinds and freedom of action. In addition, it has
curtailed the principle of property protection as formerly understood by developing another
type of interest, namely, the interest in security of transactions.
We shall find many instances in
which a bona fide purchaser acting in the ordinary course of
business has his new acquisition
protected in preference to the
older owner who, though equally
innocent of wrong, has failed to
take the necessary steps to warn
strangers of the nature of his
claim. The varieties of business
interests calling for protections
are infinite.
(4) EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT
AND PEACE. What has been said
here at some length regarding
the modern development of the
old concept of security of acquisitions applies, mutatis mutandis, to the still older postulate of
peace. This concept has grown
to include a great deal more than
the official ending of disputes.
The machinery of enforcement
includes not only litigation but
also arbitration and conciliation,
various preventive devices for
anticipating both, and an increasing quantity of contractual
control over adjective law.9 The
kind and degree of peace that are
essential for commercial prosperity at this age are, of course,
vastly different from that which
enabled savage tribes to establish trading posts to which they
would alternately bring their
goods and from which each

would recede a safe distance
while the other was present. But
it also differs in smaller measure
from the condition of commercial peace that was considered
adequate in the pioneer days of
this country, when horse traders
did not feel thoroughly equipped
for their business transactions
unless adequately armed. Nor is
the industrial peace of the early
days of unionism in this country,
when strikes were notoriously
likely to be accompanied by violence, a fair picture of the business needs of these days of
keener competition, greater publicity, and more intense interest
in industrial disputes on the part
of the legislature.
Perhaps the nature of the industrial and commercial peace of
today may best be illustrated by
reference to the exaltation of
due course to the level of a
major principle by which transactions are to be judged. It is not
only, as already indicated, that
that which is done in due course
is made to stand. The converse

is equally true. It is on this basis
that a deviation from the simple,
ordinary course of business
comes to be condemned by the
law. Thus, there was until recently nothing unlawful about a
preferential payment of a debt by
an insolvent. Business condemned the practice and now the
National Bankruptcy Act incorporates the business mans point
of view. There was nothing illegal until recently in a tradesmans act of selling goods outside of the ordinary course of
business. The business conception of due course has, however,
in spite of considerable resistance, been written into the bulk
sales laws of many jurisdictions.
Many acts that are coming to be
recognized as unfair methods of
competition are, in the final
analysis, condemned because
they are contrary to the ordinary
established course of doing
thingsbreaches of the peace as
the modern business world formulates its requirements of commercial peace.

The Law
of the Market

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

I. DISHONEST MARKETING

12

1. Misrepresentations
of Goods
When the President of the
United States made the now famous pronouncement, This proposal adds to the ancient doctrine of caveat emptor, the further doctrine, let the seller also
beware,1 was he setting a new
force in motion or was he simply
taking his place in a long line of
legal reformers bent on making
the market safe for the buyer? To
answer this question it is necessary only to enumerate the principles to which the overreached
buyer could resort before the
New Deal was written into the
statute books. In the first place,
if the misrepresentation from
which he suffered amounted to
fraud- that is, if it was a misrepresentation of past or present fact,
made knowingly or with reckless
disregard of truth or falsity, under conditions where it tended
to mislead and did mislead the
victim to his hurt the law
pounced down heavily upon the
seller. He could in all probability
be prosecuted for one of the

crimes of which fraud is an ingredient: false labeling, false
advertising, obtaining goods
under false pretense, larceny by
trick, and so on. Again, he could
be sued for damages by the defrauded party and probably
forced to pay smart money. The
contract itself could be set aside
and, under appropriate decrees
of a court of equity, the parties
restored to status quo. Or the
contract could be ignored as a
nullity if that practice best served
the needs of the victim. Finally,
the defrauder might find himself
face to face with the summary
procedure of some arm of preventive justice: a licensing commission ready to suspend his
trading license, an aroused inspector ready to impound or destroy or brand his goods, a publicity bureau ready to announce
his iniquity to the world.
2. Breach of Warranty
Even if the misrepresentation
did not technically amount to
fraud, the lying vendor would not
get off with impunity. Though he
may have innocently believed his
own lie, he may have been guilty

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

of a breach of an express warranty. An express warranty is
defined in the Uniform Sales Act
as any affirmation of fact or any
promise by the seller relating to
the goods... if the natural tendency of such affirmation or
promise is to induce the buyer
to purchase the goods.2 There
are also implied warranties
where nothing is said. The consequences of a breach of warranty, which is more easily
proved in practice than is fraud,
are, excepting for the penalties
and quasi-penalties, the same as
those of fraud. The disappointed
buyer may keep the goods and
sue for damages, or call the bargain off, or take other steps to
restore the status quo. Obviously
the law did not allow so much
lying as the old by-word suggested.
3. Reforms in Laws to
Prevent Dishonesty
Nevertheless, there were and
are possibilities of unpunished
dishonesty in the market place,
some of which can be more effectively coped with as time goes
on. The reforms of the last gen-

for what he says or otherwise
represents to be true under fraud
and warranty laws that take him
at his word. In addition, there are
numerous laws altogether preventing the sale of harmful
drugs, or at least putting dangerous ones subject to the requirement of a physicians prescription. There are, furthermore,
standards of purity established
by authority, a comprehensive
United States Pharmacopoeia.
It would be a mistake, however, to attribute all this change
to the internal workings of the
law. The impetus has come from
many sources, including educational campaigns conducted by
medical associations, magazine
publishers, Better Business Bureaus, government departments.
The important point for our consideration is that the law of the
market has been able to respond
to the demand for a higher standard of honesty and has potentialities within it for still higher
standards, as society becomes
ready for them. The fraud formula must remain elastic.
What has been said of the
prevention of misrepresentation
applies with little change to the
prevention of other undesirable
conditions and practices in the
market: monopolistic conditions,
unfair competition, incompetence, lack of responsibility, and
in general one-sidedness or a
loading of factors against the
buyer. Still, each of these tasks
of the law has its own interesting peculiarities as well as historic accidents meriting separate
attention.
II. MONOPOLISTIC
PRACTICES.
1. Development
of Anti-monopolistic Laws
The laws against monopoly
are very old. In the Middle Ages
there were laws against forestalling, engrossing and regrat-

www.suspicions.com

ing, not to mention several subvarieties, the gist of which was
interference with the opportunities of the citizens of a town to
get their needs provided for in
their regular market. The injury
resulting to one citizen from
anothers simple trick of buying
up the days supply of foodstuffs
on its way to town was a palpable
one, to be combated regardless
of any theory of the function of
competition in society.3 Actually,
medieval society did not rely on
competition to set the right price
on all its goods and services. It
did not hesitate to name a just
price and a fair wage by decree.
When we turn, however, to the
late nineteenth century revival of
interest in anti-monopoly laws,
we find a society permeated with
the notion that competition is in
itself good, the very life of trade,
and on the whole perhaps adequate for its effective regulation
provided that artificial interference with its workings is not tolerated. It is no part of the function of the law to propound or to
correct economic theories, but it
must serve as the vehicle
through which a society tries to
put its theory into practice.
Since the Sherman Anti-Trust
Act was passed in 1890 there has
been an increasing tendency to
supplement its workings by reliance on regulation, including
price fixing, notably but not exclusively in the fields of railroad
and public utility law. In the National Industrial Recovery Act of
1933, held unconstitutional on
other grounds,4 there was even
a suspension of the workings of
the anti-trust laws in favor of
detailed regulation calculated to
assure the public of the fair treatment that was the, primary objective of the anti-trust laws. With
a changing economic philosophy, or at least a changing degree of faith in the efficacy of
competition, we may expect
more experimental legislation in
the direction of regulation. The

Suspicions News Magazine

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

eration may be cited to indicate
the current tendencies. The most
outstanding of these are: First,
a readier assumption by courts
and juries that lies tend to mislead and do mislead. Second, a
host of statutes on phases of
fraud covering such subjects as
false labeling and advertising;
the plain marking of substitutes,
imitations, artificial coloring or
flavoring, the country of origin
of goods; the publishing of the
essential facts pertaining to securities offered for sale; presumptions and burdens of proof
in certain cases, and a tightening of procedure and a stiffening of penalties in others. Third,
the intensive development of
preventive measures against
fraud, including licensing of persons, inspection of products,
publicity, and the extra-judicial
administrative machinery that
goes with preventive justice.
To illustrate all of these tendencies we need only consider
the recent history of patent medicine advertising. One need not
be very old to remember when
the patent medicine man made
unlimited claims for his concoctions of alcohol, herbs and flavoring matter. No one was expected to take him literally,
whether he barked about his
elixir from the tail of his circus
wagon or printed startling pictures labeled Before Taking and
After Taking in the advertising
columns of the rural magazine.
Hence, two essential elements of
fraud were missing: the tendency
to mislead and the actual misleading. The exaggerations were
glossed over as dealers puffing.
Today the vendor of patent medicines has to contend with a Federal Pure Foods and Drugs Act,
quite likely to be strengthened,
a Federal Trade Commission,
fraud orders of the Post Office
Department, the scrutiny of the
radio licensing authorities, the
state advertising laws, and direct
responsibility, criminal and civil,

13

whole agitation for a planned
economy is based on this loss of
faith in the efficacy of competition as a planning force, a
faith which in the nineteenth century was rationalized by paralleling it with the theory of evolution.

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

2. Innovations
in Anti-trust Laws
Remembering, then, that the
Sherman Act speaks in terms of
1890, let us examine its innovations.

14

(1) CONTRACTS IN RESTRAINT OF TRADE. Contracts
in restraint of trade were void
according to common law.
Whether combinations in restraint of trade effected otherwise than by contractfor example, by means of trusteeship
were void was debatable, but we
may assume that even without
the aid of statute the law would
have reached them. Just how serious the restraint had to be in
order to be obnoxious to the law
was debated anew with each case
that reached the courts. Here,
too, we may assume a rule of reason would have developed without the aid of a statute. But to
declare an arrangement void is
to use only one of the sanctions
of the law. It does not subject the
perpetrators to a penalty, it does
not lay them open to an action
for damages at the instance of
those whom they have hurt, it
does not provide for undoing
what they have done. These sanctions were provided by the
Sherman Act.
(2) PREVENTION OF MONOPOLISTIC PRACTICES. It was
not until 1914 that the modern
approach of prevention was applied in the Federal anti-trust
laws. In that year not only did the
Clayton Act attempt to nip evil
in the bud by prohibiting practices found likely to contribute
to the upbuilding of monopolies,

but the Federal Trade Commission Act provided for the watchfulness of a commission with
wide discretion to preserve the
proper workings of the competitive system.
(3) RULE OF REASON IN INTERPRETATION OF LAWS. The interpretation of the Federal antitrust act and of the state acts
modeled after it has led to a series of important Supreme Court
decisions that go beyond the
mere verbal logic of ordinary
statutory interpretation. They
have worked out the principle
that it is the substance and not
the form that counts in determining whether a particular combination is illegal. Furthermore,
they have established the rule of
reason, which, stripped of its
verbiage, merely means that by
no means every contract which
restrains trade or limits competition is obnoxious (for in a measure every contract does so), and
that the only standard which the
court can read into the statute
without arbitrariness is the general standard of reasonableness.
(4) SUPPORT BY EVIDENCE.
In reviewing the findings of the
Federal Trade Commission the
court has generally felt unable to
question its finding of fact because of the peculiar wording of
the statute which provides that
such findings shall stand if supported by evidence. Had it said
the evidence, the court might
have been called upon to weigh
the evidence itself, but, as it is,
the only question before the
court is whether there was any
evidence to support the finding.
It would be a sorry case indeed
if there were none at all.
The significance of this limitation on the courts is frequently
overlooked by law writers as well
as laymen in interpreting decisions under the Federal Trade
Commission Act. Thus, in the
famous Beech-Nut case,5 which

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

involved the systematic attempt
of a manufacturer to thwart price
cutters (the very aim that is now
upheld by the Miller-Tydings Act6
and similar legislation in most of
our states7), the court had before
it the finding of the Commission
that the manufacturer was guilty
of participating in some kind of
a conspiracy in restraint of trade,
and there was little for the court
to do with that question of fact
officially settled.
(5) UNFAIR METHOD OF
COMPETITION. Partly as a result
of this control given to the Commission, but in part at least with
the encouragement of the court,
the term unfair method of competition, the subject of the prohibition of the important fifth
section of the Act, has come to
be looked upon rather paradoxically as the equivalent of undue
interference with competition. In
other words, a clause which, by
necessary implication, recognizes the possibility that there
may be bad competition as well
as good, becomes submerged in
the philosophy which upholds
competition for its own sake. In
the Beech-Nut case, already alluded to, Mr. Justice Holmes is a
voice crying in the wilderness
when he says that the practices
complained of are neither unfair
nor competitive. Thus, the
phrase becomes a blanket authority for enumerating objectionable practicesobjectionable principally because they
tend to foster monopoly and because they involve fraud upon
the publicand put them under
an administrative ban.
It was partly owing to this
confusion of terms and the trade
practice conferences that grew
out of it, that the unfortunate
National Industrial Recovery Act
proposed Codes of Fair Competition and that the term was
promptly understood by administrators and business men as
meaning codes prescribing and

proscribing practices with little
or no thought of competition.
Even the Supreme Court in the
Schechter case 8 expressed
doubt, in the face of such practical interpretation, whether the
meaning of the phrase had any
logical connection with the
meanings of the words that composed it. Finally, to remove all
doubt, the language has been
amended in the Federal Trade
Commission Act so as to include
any unfair method of competition or unfair or deceptive act or
practice in commerce.9 At the
same time, the scope of the act
has been broadened so as to include a good deal of false advertising regardless of whether injury to a competitor or even the
existence of a competitor can be
shown. The new version of the
Act, therefore, transcends the
limits of an anti-monopoly law.

4. Extension of Unfair
Competition to Special Cases
Unfair competition, in spite
of the incidental and cavalier
treatment of it as part of the antitrust laws of the country, has a
significance outside of those
laws. It is linked up with trademarks and trade names. In fact,
we may conveniently think of the
term as embracing infringements of trade-marks, trade
names, copyrights, patents, and
other exclusive rights; palming
off goods as those of an-other;
and any other conduct that tends
without legal justification to hurt
the business of a competitor. An
official enumeration would have
the negative value of suggesting
heretofore unimagined tricks,
allowing to each, as to the common-law dog, at least one bite.
The basis on which the aggrieved
competitor or customer or the
government or a commission
may institute a complaint or seek
redress will differ widely in the
above cases which do not belong
in any single legal category, however much they resemble each
other in effect, and however
much the courts and the lawmakers may desire to exclude
that effect from the market place.
To treat of all of them might get

www.suspicions.com

us into such diverse pockets of
the law, as libel, in the case
where one undertaker slyly sent
his competitors cards to the
families of sick persons, and corporation law, where deception is
carried out with the aid of a
wholly owned subsidiary which
parades as an independent corporation.
(1) GENERAL ASPECTS OF
UNFAIR COMPETITION RECOGNIZED BY LAW. For our purposes,
it will be better at this point to
confine ourselves to those general aspects of unfair competition which the law recognizes,
regardless of the means used,
and add a few comments on the
peculiarities of some of the more
important situations. In general,
the law envisages unfair competition through the eye of the customer or the public, except in
those cases where an exclusive
right has crystallized into a kind
of property for the competitor,
as in true trade-mark, copyright,
or patent. Unless the public is
deceived or a specially protected
right is involved, it is quite possible to annoy or even hurt a
competitor without violating any
law. Thus, my competitor may
copy with impunity my original
plan for selling goods on credit,
or my clever design for a garment, or my well-planned window display, or my combination
offer, so long as he does not
thereby mislead anyone into
thinking that his customer is
dealing with me. Some of these
acts in competition appear quite
unfair to the business man. He
has coined the phrase design
piracy. He legislated against it
in the NRA days and he has cooperated with trade associations
and the Fashion Originators
Guild of America to put it down.13
We may look forward to more
effective protection of ideas in
the future, but the law of unfair
competition as such still bears
the marks of its original aim- the

Suspicions News Magazine

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

3. Anti-competitive
Legislation
Whether because of a change
of economic philosophy or because of the purely empirical discovery of harms flowing from unrestrained competition, there
have been engrafted on the antimonopolistic acts certain anticompetitive clauses generally
disguised for political reasons as
anti-trust laws. Such disguise is
possible because the competitors whose activities are curtailed
are presumably large competitors on the way to becoming
monopolies. Most noteworthy of
these are the Robinson-Patman
amendment10 to the Clayton Act,
and the fair practice acts culminating in the Miller-Tydings
law.11 The former tends to prohibit the large retailer from utilizing some of his bargaining
power in buying; the latter, to
prohibit him from using his advantages in underselling his
small competitor in certain protected classes of goods. Both
types are at this stage limited
experiments calling for much

administrative implementing,
judicial interpretation, the watching of loopholes and by-passes
open to aggressive competitors,
and legislative amendment. The
new state and Federal laws requiring employers to submit to
collective bargaining with employees12 are also, so far as they
go, anti-competitive in their intent. Whatever social benefits
may be sought by anti-competitive legislationand there are
many- no law can save us from
paying for these benefits
through higher prices and a sacrifice of the advantages claimed
for intensive competition when
trust-busting was the order of
the day.

protection of the interest of the
public.

16

(2) TRADE SYMBOLS. (a) Selling or Licensing of Trade Symbols to Others. Another consequence of looking at this branch
of law through the eyes of the
public is manifest in the rule that
a trade-mark or trade name cannot be sold or licensed out in
gross. That is to say, even if I
have created, popularized and
consequently own such a name
as Ivory applied to soap or Red
Cross to mattresses, I cannot
authorize you to use the name
on similar products of yours with
which I have no connection. Familiarity with the practice of licensing by patentees, or the authorization to reprint given by
copyright owners, has frequently
misled business men into the
trap of licensing others to use
their trade symbols. But a trade
symbol is nothing but a shorthand way of telling the public of
your connection with the goods,
and if you are not connected with
them, your licensing another to
use the symbol is merely authorizing him to tell a lie, and this
the law will not countenance.
Just what connection must
one have with the goods to make
an arrangement for the use of his
trade symbol on them proper?
The answer depends on another
question, a shifting question of
business fact: What does the
trade symbol say to the ordinary
member of the public? A generation ago the judges were quite
ready with an approximate answer to this business question.
They said that a trade symbol
indicated origin or ownership of
goods. Today a more careful answer is called for. There are, for
example, legitimate dealers
marks or even brokers marks, as
well as manufacturers, and they
may speak of care in selection,
willingness to warrant, uniformity of grade, or the possession
of some quality suggested by the

name or by an acquired meaning of the name under the force
of usage and advertising. Once
we determine precisely what the
symbol says, we are able to answer our original question:
whether the proper facts are
there to justify a license or a
transfer of the right to use a
name.
(b) Preservation of Trade
Names. The preservation of trade
names as ones own property
presents a serious and at times
an insuperable problem. Apparently one may lose his exclusive
right to such invented words as
escalator, listerine, vaseline, tabloid, mulsified, aspirin, and
kodak, not merely by abandonment but through no fault of his
own, if the public actually appropriates the word and makes it
mean a class of articles regardless of who makes them.14
(c) Registration of Trade
Names. Registration of trade
names under state and Federal
statutes does not, in general,
bestow rights. It merely makes
clear the proof of the facts on
which rights are based, and it
gives notice to the world of these
facts from the date of registration. Such notice may, however,
itself have the effect of a fact
when we ask what territory is
preempted by a particular use of
a name. In the absence of registration, it is possible to have the
same name developed simultaneously in several parts of the
country or even in several cities
in a single state. As a business
expands territorially, it becomes
necessary at times to draw
boundary lines around the territory belonging to each user.15
But after a state registration, it
is difficult to hold a new user in
another part of the state, or after a national registration, a new
user elsewhere in the nation,
entirely without blame.

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

(d) Boundaries of Articles
Covered by Trade Symbols. An
even more difficult problem concerns the boundaries around articles covered by a trade symbol.
Again, the publics view is the
test. Is the public likely to be
misled by the use of the word
Philco, well known in the radio
business, on safety razors?16 We
must keep in mind that this is a
business question and that the
answer is likely to change as
manufacturing and marketing
habits change. Courts have, it is
true, attempted to list classes of
articles such as foods, clothing,
and machinery, to help them in
solving this problem, but such
classes are at best approximate
and subject to change. And after they are made, the specific
questions are as fact-ridden as
ever: are chewing gum and tobacco in the same sub-class; are
silk stockings and silk underwear; are shoes and hats?
(e) Similarity of Trade Symbols. Looking at trade symbols
through the public eye forces us
to regard the offense of infringement as complete when there is
similarity though not identity. If
two boxes of cigars look enough
alike to be mistaken for each
other when not seen together, it
is idle to bring experts to testify
that the types used in the printed
matter are of different fonts, or
the colors are distributed differently or the names spelled differently. The question is not whether
an expert, setting the two boxes
down together in good light with
a ruler and magnifying glass, can
distinguish the counterfeit from
the genuine; it is, rather, whether
the transient cigar buyer in the
smoky atmosphere of the dimly
lighted shop is likely to overlook
the difference.
(f) Absence of a Technical
Trade-mark. Furthermore, the
public can be deceived in the
absence of a true technical trade-

mark or trade name, and the law
should protect it. It has long
been laid down that one cannot
make a trade name out of a descriptive or geographic term, and
there are other limitations sometimes expressed by saying, You
cannot appropriate any part of
the dictionary and exclude others from using it. Nor can you
appropriate a color or number or
ordinary style of package as your
own. And yet the law will not
permit another to steal your
good-will by deliberately pretending to the public that his
product is yours just because
you have neglected to perfect a
technical trademark or trade
name for yourself. Of course, you
have a more difficult case if you
must prove unfair competition
without infringement of a trade
symbol. You will have to show
longer usage in order to convince
the court that color of wrapping
or combination of ordinary descriptive and geographic words
has come to mark a product as
yours. But it can be done, and
the possibility is the basis of a
harvest of legal cases every year.

(b) Similarity of Manufacturers Names. The most difficult
case of all arises where one
wishes to use his own name for
a product that has previously
been introduced by an-other of
the same name. Obviously there
are three conflicting interests to
be adjusted. The prevailing interest is again that seen through
the eye of the public. One owns
his name, but he has no more
right to use it to injure the public than he has to use his crowbar for such a purpose. Injunctions are frequently granted to
prevent such misuse of ones
own name. They should, however, be no broader than necessary to effectuate this proper
end. Thus, it may be sufficient
to demand a slight difference in
the set-up of the name, or a notice differentiating the producer
of goods or the owner of a store
from an established business
bearing the same name; or it may
be necessary to demand a complete cessation of the use of the
name. The courts will sometimes
feel their way. In the case where
a grocer named W. H. Baker lent
his name to a chocolate bar
dressed up to imitate the bar
long sold by Walter Baker & Company, the court found it necessary, because of his persistence

www.suspicions.com

in what seemed a deliberate attempt to benefit by the good-will
of the old established house, to
broaden the injunction until it
became unconditional.18 The
first comer in such matters obviously has some advantages over
later comers, because his interest happens to coincide with that
of the public.
III. LICENSING TO PREVENT
INCOMPETENCE OR
IRRESPONSIBILITY
To rid the market of incompetence, inefficiency, and irresponsibility, the chief resort of
modem law is to licensing. We
are so accustomed to the requirement of licenses for all kinds of
activity from owning a dog to
driving an automobile, and particularly for the privilege of engaging in business or following
professions, that it is hard to realize how recent a development
we are dealing with here. As late
as 1883 Mr. Justice Field of the
Supreme Court of the United
States declared that it was the
distinctive right of every American citizen to carry on the ordinary businesses of life without
let or hindrance.19 Even while he
was speaking, a development
was under way to require the licensing of physicians and lawyers, pharmacists and dentists.
Soon the humbler callings of
plumber and sewer tapper were
included. By the end of the century, hundreds of cases had been
decided in the highest courts of
the several states and in the Supreme Court of the United States,
upholding attempts to subject
practically every known industry
to the licensing power of the
state or its agencies. Many of
these licenses are perfunctory.
They are really petty privilege
taxes. Others are based on careful examinations, character studies and records. The potential
control of the market by the gov-

(3) NAMES OF PATENTED ARTICLES. The names of patented
articles are in a different legal
class. An article worthy of a
patent must be something new,
and it is entitled to a new name.
The patentee gives it that name.
When the patent expires, the
whole world has the right to
make the article and to call it by
its name. Nice questions may
arise as to whether the name of
the patented article includes the
patentees name. Can anyone
make a Singer Sewing Machine
and sell it under that name? Or a
Stillson wrench? Obviously it may
be wise, during the life of a
patent, to popularize not only the
official name but a trade name
or mark, as well, that can preserve for you such goodwill as
you have earned, for the time
when the patent itself expires.

(a) Expiration of Patent. A
curious instance of the combination of the principles of the
last two paragraphs is found in
the Shredded Wheat case.17 At
the expiration of the patent in
1912, presumably anyone could
have made the product and
called it Shredded Wheat. But
apparently no one did, and in the
course of fifteen years the question arose whether beginning at
scratch on the date of the expiration of the patent, the manufacturers had succeeded in putting into the words a secondary
meaning. The Supreme Court
recognized the possibility, but
held that it had not taken place.

ernment, which is inherent in the
license system, still lies ahead of
us. In the National Industrial Recovery Act, national licensing for
all businesses was prescribed as
an extreme measure.
The licensing power, however, does not in theory go so far
as to authorize a state or national
planned economy. That issue was
fought out in the case of New
State Ice Company v. Liebmann.20
The State of Oklahoma had provided that no license be given to
any ice company unless it had
first procured from designated
authorities a certificate of public convenience and necessity.
Such certificates have in the past
been required as conditions precedent to establishing new public utility enterprises, banks and
a few other types of business
charged with a public interest.
The Supreme Court held (Mr. Justice Brandeis dissenting) that in
the case of such an ordinary business as the manufacture of ice it
was not for the state to say how
many competing units were desirable. It is true, of course, that
licensing is sometimes perverted
into a means of keeping down
competition in an industry or
profession. Those who are in,
easily persuade themselves that
standards ought to be raised for
newcomers. Nevertheless, if this
is the avowed motive of licensing, it is unconstitutional. If an
officially planned market becomes a desideratum, we must
either amend the Constitution or
resort to such subterfuges as
purchasing compliance, after the
manner of the Agricultural
Adjustment Act, 21 which was
held unconstitutional on other
grounds, and of the Bituminous
Coal Act of 1937.22

Market Facilities

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

I. THE USE OF CONTRACTS

20

For the successful conduct of
business it is not enough to police the market-place and rid it
of the dangers discussed in the
last chapter. It is necessary also
to provide reasonable facilities
for its work, and among these
not the least important are facilitating laws. The greatest part
of this service is rendered by the
law of Contracts, legally recognized and enforceable agreements. Contracts are involved in
every sale of goods or lands, or
other valuables such as securities or goodwill, in every lease,
in every extension of credit, in
every act of employment, in arranging for such services as the
carriage of goods and passengers, in using the communication facilities furnished by the
mails or the telephone and telegraph companiesin fact, wherever money is used, and in some
transactions even where it is not
used. A study of contracts would
thus overlap, besides market facilities, a great many other parts
of our study, such as Credit and
Organization in business, and
some domestic and property ar-

rangements scattered through
other volumes of this work. A
general treatment of the principles of contract law is accordingly presented elsewhere (Volume VI). At this stage we are concerned, rather, with some specific contracts in common use in
business than with principles
common to all contracts.
1. Development
of the Law of Contracts
It appears, then, that the
warp and woof of modem business is contractual. It was not
always so. We can picture places
in the old world where the external appearances of life have not
changed materially since the late
Middle Ages. The man we now
see working in the field is completely enmeshed in contracts.
He is a tenant by virtue of a contract, or is employed by contract.
In turn, he employs others in the
same way. He sells his produce
by contracts and acquires what
he needs in like manner. Yet his
ancestor, who did the same kind
of work and lived a similar life,
was scarcely touched by contract
law. He was born into a status
under the feudal system, and by

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

reason of that status had certain
rights and duties in his relations
to those above him and those
associated with him or below him
in the social-economic-political
structure of his time to which we
have given the name feudalism.
If we ask why and how this great
change has come about, we shall
find the answer in a whole literature, the nucleus of which will be
found in a famous sentence
penned by Sir Henry Maine in
1861: The movement of the
progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from Status to Contract.1 Nineteenth
century writers attributed a good
deal of significance to this formula. They saw freedom in the
contract principle which said that
no man (in the absence of fault)
should be held to owe duties to
his fellow men unless he had
voluntarily undertaken them.
The status theory of duties suggested serfdom or slavery, which
had been abolished in Great Britain and its possessions earlier in
the century and was soon to disappear in America and Russia
and throughout the civilized
world.

2. Freedom of Contract
In this country the doctrine
grew to be a dogma of constitutional law, though it is not
written into the Constitution of
the United States: the dogma of
freedom of contract. Under it, at
the end of the nineteenth century and in the first years of the
twentieth century, a good many
legislative efforts to dictate the
terms of contracts were
thwarted. Not only were statutes
with reference to the labor contract thrown out unless clearly
within the police power of the
state, but price regulation and
the exclusion of unfair terms in
types of contracts that had come
to be one-sided were deemed
impossible. The only exception
of importance was that public
utilities (including carriers) were
subject to such control as to
make them duty bound not only
to contract with all members of
the public without discrimination, but to treat them all fairly,
and the authorities were beginning to interpret this to mean
that the rates and other terms
could be fixed by legislative or
properly authorized administrative action.

4. Advantages of
Standardized Contracts
As other contracts have been
standardized and still more are
being standardized in the same
waynotably, bills of lading,
warehouse receipts, sales of
goods, sales of securities, real
estate transactions, and bankingit will be worth our while to
consider the workings of the laws
to standardize insurance agreements. In the first place, the
elimination of specialized phrasing has greatly decreased litigation over the meaning of terms.
All of the standard phrases have
been judicially defined. The provisions are reasonably two-sided.
It is possible to buy insurance
quickly and, at least in ordinary
cases, without expensive expert
advice including legal advice.
Furthermore, it is possible to
cover parts of the same hazard
in different companies without
sowing a wind and reaping a
whirlwind of confusion. It is possible to master, once for all, the
essentials of each type of contract, as it was impossible to
carry in mind a clear picture of
what each individualized contract covered or failed to cover
in the past. The companies benefit almost as much as their customers. Whatever competition
they maintain, they are not
forced to weigh in the balance
non-comparable clauses. So a

www.suspicions.com

great deal of sales resistance has
disappeared. Peculiar insurance
contracts are still possible to
meet peculiar situations, but the
advantages of the standardized
policies are such that they have
come to prevail almost as generally as they would had the legislature been empowered to say
any contract to the contrary notwithstanding, and had it been
so minded.
5. Disadvantages of
Standardized Contracts
The advantages of standardizing contracts are not unlike
those of standardizing machinery, and the government may
play a similar part in both processes. There are, on the other
hand, the same kinds of disadvantages. The standard gauge of
machine or cut of clothing that
serves the average case best
may not serve any actual case
so well as the made-to-measure
article would. So, we shall see,
the standardized contract of
sale fits many modern situations
rather poorly. Furthermore,
standardization makes change
to meet new conditions rather
difficult. The standard gauge of
railroad tracks is said to be
based, in the last analysis, on
the strength of a horse. No matter how powerful engines can be
made in the foreseeable future,
it is difficult to see a change in
this gauge as long as trains run
on tracks. In like manner, a standardized contract for any given
purpose, whether it be insurance, banking, or the sale of
clothing, is likely to resist adjustment to the changing needs
of a dynamic society. We shall
find ample illustrations in the
most important standard contract of the market, that established in the Uniform Sales Act,
or in the common law of Sales
of the last century which it faithfully codifies.

3. In Absence of
Agreement to Contrary
A practical compromise was
possible about the turn of the
century, when the theory of freedom of contract was at its height.
However chary a legislature had
to be in using the phrase any
contract to the contrary notwithstanding, it could readily say in
the absence of any agreement or
contract to the contrary, and lay
down the whole or the essential
part of a standardized contract
to fit any given situation. It was
in this way that the State of New
York, after an important study of
insurance companies, wrote into
its statute books a series of standard insurance policies which
were to cover all cases in this
absence of written agreements to

the contrary. Only a few provisions were put beyond the control of the parties, and these were
presumably justified under the
police power- that somewhat
vague power of the states to protect public health, safety and
morals. Many other states followed the example of New York.
Eventually, standardized insurance policies took the place of
the widely varying, somewhat
treacherous, one-sided documents that had become a scandal under the regime of freedom
of contract.

II. UNIFORM SALES LAW

22

1. Standardized Contract of
the Uniform Sales Act
A sale may be defined, for our
purposes, as the transfer of ownership of goods for a consideration called a price. So definedother definitions are also possibleit is not a contract; it is
merely a step in the performance
of a contract of sale. The contract
may call for an immediate performance or a future performance. It is also possible that,
for one reason or another, such
as delay in completing the
goods, the performance takes
place after the time agreed upon.
We are for the moment concerned with the contract rather
than with the nature of ownership and its legal consequences.
There are, or may be, other details in the performance of the
seller than a recognition of the
thing as yours and no longer his,
from a given moment. He must
at least surrender possession,
and probably also the title or
indicia of ownership, and he may
be bound by the contract to
package, condition, transport,
set up, or service the thing sold;
he may be bound to defend your
claim to it against all comers or
only certain comers; he may be
bound to make good certain or
all defects and pay damages for
losses resulting from defects, or
take the goods back or stand
behind them in other ways. He
may have bound himself to give
up possession without being
paid and wait a stated time for
his money. He may have agreed
to insure the goods, to make
proper arrangements on your
behalf with a carrier for their
transportation. He may have
bound himself to keep spare
parts on hand and to supply
them to you at reasonable rates;
likewise, to carry in stock
improvements and gadgets that
may be added, from time to time,
to the article sold by the manu-

facturer. He may have agreed to
take the article back under certain conditions and pay back or
allow in trade parts of the price
according to a schedule. Perhaps
he has agreed not to sell goods
of the same pattern to your competitors. It is, of course, impossible to exhaust the list of
auxiliary promises that may be
made by a seller in connection
with his promise to transfer the
title and possession of his goods.
Similar promises can be made
by the buyer in addition to the
primary undertaking to pay for
the goods. Though it is not likely
that a great many of the stipulations enumerated above exist together in any ordinary contract,
it is even more unlikely that, in
the ordinary course of business,
we shall come across a sale in
which none of them accompany
the transfer of title. Hence, it is
better, for purposes of analysis,
to follow the English version of
the Sales of Goods Act, which recognizes a Contract of Sale in every case, than the American version, which speaks of a Contract
for the Sale of Goods if the transfer of ownership is postponed,
and a Sale (with no allusion to any
contract) if the transfer of ownership is immediate.
2. Special Stipulations in
Individual Contracts of Sale
If all of the terms of every
contract of sale had to be mentioned, to say nothing of a requirement of writing, the ordinary haberdashers clerk could
perhaps, with the aid of a lawyer, sell a single collar or tie in a
day, and at the end of the day he
would be completely exhausted.
With standardization, he blandly
wraps up package after package
while chatting about the
weather, and lets the law dictate
the terms as to what may and
what may not be expected of the
goods. But on what principle
does the existing Sales Law make
its selection among all the pos-

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

sible contracts that the parties
could conceivably make were
they minded to write special
stipulations?
To answer this question we
must bear in mind the type of
sale that was most common in
England while this law was in its
formative stage, a century ago,
rather than the type of sale with
which we are today familiar in the
large stores m urban centers.
Thus, the sale presumed is a
cash-and-carry transaction; it is,
in the absence of the proof of a
contrary intent, the task of the
buyer to pick up the goods as
they are at the sellers place of
business or home or wherever
they may be, and carry them
away. From this presumption
arose the complicated result that
the carrier is generally to be considered the agent of the buyer in
getting the goods, rather than of
the seller in carrying them.
Hence, claims against the railroad company are normally made
by the consignee; hence, also,
the goods in the hands of the
carrier, even if they are being
sent C.O.D., are looked upon as
already in the possession of the
buyer. And since liens are based
on possession, it is too late to
enforce a lien, strictly speaking,
if the goods are in transit, even
though at that stage it is discovered that the buyer is insolvent.
For this reason there has grown
up a very technical doctrine of
stoppage in transitu, to restore
the goods to a position in which
a lien or its equivalent can once
more be asserted by the seller.
Furthermore, as there is no presumption that credit is to be extended, the seller is entitled to
hold the goods until there is a
tender of payment, in the absence of specifications to the
contrary. Out of this notion
grows the vendors lien.
3. Implied Warranties
(1) ABSENCE OF PROVISION
FOR THE MIDDLEMAN. Another

feature of the type of sale contemplated which reflects the past
rather than the present is the
absence of provision for the
middleman. Practically all of the
warranties recited as implied
assume that the only buyer contemplated is a consumer, and the
sellers are dealt with as growers
or manufacturers, whether they
be growers or manufacturers or
not.2 Warranties do not run with
the goodsthat is to say, even
if branded goods are bought
from a middleman who obviously
has nothing to do with their
preparation, the buyer must look
to him for any warranties, and he
in turn may or may not have recourse to the manufacturer. The
law has, it is true, done something to meet this condition, but
not within the Sales Act nor under the heading of warranties.
The disappointed buyer may
make his claim against the negligent manufacturer, if at all, only
on the ground that it was a tort
to send poisonous or otherwise
dangerous goods out into the
world without proper warnings.

4. Rules Vesting
Title in the Buyer
The type of sale contemplated, furthermore, is the sale
of goods ready for transfer over
the counter, in which case the
sale is consummated when the
contract is made.
Hence, on the question when
title passes, after stating that it
all depends upon the contract
which, in turn, is the intent of the
parties, to be gathered from the
words, surrounding circumstances, customs, and other relevant evidencethe Act proceeds to lay down a series of
rules to be. resorted to in extreme cases of doubt, and these
rules favor the earliest possible
vesting of title in the buyer. Thus,
the first of them assumes this
extreme and rather surprising
form: Where there is an unconditional contract to sell specific
goods, in a deliverable state, the
property in the goods passes to
the buyer when the contract is
made, and it is immaterial
whether the time of payment, or.
the time of delivery, or both, be
postponed. 3 Literally interpreted, this would mean that if
A sold his automobile to B on
January 1st, to be delivered and
paid for on February 1st, B might
expect a telephone call any time
during the month of January in-

www.suspicions.com

forming him that his automobile
(that is, Bs) had been stolen or
destroyed, and that he could take
whatever steps were still open to
protect his interests, but that A
would still have to be paid at the
time agreed upon. This, of
course, would seem like arrant
nonsense to B. All that the rule
and those that follow it mean is
that where the case permits of
such an interpretation at all,
early vesting of title in the purchaser is to be preferred to later
possible dates.
5. Deviations from the Sales
ActSpecial Sales Agreements
In view of the inadequacy of
the simple picture of sales that
is taken from the life of a century or two centuries ago, it frequently becomes necessary to
draw up special sales agreements, or at least stipulations, to
cover phases of the sales contract for particular purposes. A
comparison of the sales form
used by a large corporation with
its order form will indicate at
once the latitude possible in
making deviations from the Sales
Act. The tendency of the sales
form is to shift every possible
risk to the buyer. The tendency
of the order form is the opposite,
and in addition it is likely to
specify warranties of a technical
type, such as the one against
patent infringement, and to deviate markedly from the assumptions of the Sales Act by covering credit terms, plans for packing and delivery, opportunities
for inspection and even devices
for self-help in case of disappointment on the part of the
buyer.4 On the other hand, it is
not unusual for both buyer and
seller to favor a deviation from
the law which refuses to excuse
a man from his contractual
obligation in the face of hardships not of his own making. A
stipulation making an order or a
promise to sell subject to strikes,
lockouts, fires or other unavoid-

Suspicions News Magazine

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

(2) WARRANTIES APPLICABLE TO CONSUMER-PURCHASER. An examination of the
details of the implied warranties
will bear out the picture of (a) the
consumer-purchaser dealing
with a manufacturing dealer,
rather than (b) of a dealer-purchaser or manufacturing-purchaser. The first implied warranty
is that, where there is reliance on
the judgment of the seller that
the goods are fit for the buyers
purpose, there is an implied warranty that the goods are fit for
such a purpose. Another warranty is that, when one buys
goods from a dealer the goods
are of merchantable qualityand
merchantable, though it might
originally have meant fit to be
resold, has, since the Sales Act
was adopted, been pretty definitely interpreted to mean merely
standard quality.

(3) USE OF TRADE NAME
AND WARRANTY. Where goods
are bought by their patent or
other trade name there is no
warranty that they are fit for any
purpose. On the other hand,
patent or trade names are coming definitely to have secondary
meanings, as a result of the advertising that goes into them,
and it is reasonable to read into
the use of the name a warranty
that the goods have all the qualities or ingredients for which that
name has come to be an abbreviated method of statement. For
this development, the Act makes
no provision.

able causes for delay or non-performance is not unusual.

III. SPECIALLY REGULATED
CONTRACTS

24

Although current law regards
most of the other services rendered in business as fitting into
the frame of contract, it has become necessary to recognize and
regulate certain peculiar features
of these relations, so that we may
again look upon many of them
as they were looked upon in
Black-stones day when they were
more standardized. Of course,
the details of the standardization
of the twentieth century differ
from those of the eighteenth.
Thus, it is possible to view the
duties of the carrier both of persons and of goods, the duties of
the insurance company and certain public utilities, of banks and
trust companies, commodity and
security exchanges, public warehousemen and many others engaged in dealing with the public, as dictated only in part by
contract and in large measure by
rules of law, some of which are
set down in the absence of any
contract to the contrary, and others, any contract to the contrary
notwithstanding. Even where it
is legally possible to deviate, it
may be difficult if not impossible
in practice to substitute ones
own terminology: hence such
rules are, in effect, a return to
status. We may select, from this
list of special services, twothat
of the insurer and that of the
public utilityto illustrate
phases of their development pertinent to the study of other typical business services.
1. Substantive Law of
Insurance
The essence of an insurance
contract is an agreement
whereby the insurer agrees to
reimburse the insured for a loss.
The insurer may, of course, be a

group of persons including the
insured, and the total significance of the contract may be to
spread the loss over the whole
group instead of leaving it on the
shoulders of the individual upon
whom it falls. On the other hand,
the insurer may be a group of
underwriters or a corporation
that entered into the business on
a purely commercial basis. By
carefully calculating the probabilities of loss over a widespread field, the insurer can reimburse itself through the collection of a premium which is a
small percentage of the risk covered in any particular case. These
terms apply pretty clearly to
marine insurance, in which the
whole plan probably originated.
They are almost equally applicable to fire, accident, theft, tornado and even credit insurance.
Some stretching may be necessary in order to make them apply to life insurance, for life insurance has two phases: though
the time of death is uncertain,
its eventual occurrence is certain.
Hence, life insurance involves the
building up of an estate which
will eventually be paid over, as
well as the covering of the risk
of premature death before the
estate is built up. The estatebuilding side is, therefore, somewhat akin to the function of a
savings bank. Its difference is
that, instead of holding various
sums calculated individually for
each depositor, the insurance
company holds a lump sum, in
which all of its depositors have
an interest, to be partitioned
among the individuals in accordance with unforeseeable events.
(1) CONTRACTS
OVER
WEIGHTED AGAINST THE CUSTOMER. During the days of freedom of contract, insurance
companies had a tendency to
write their own lengthy and
complicated agreements giving
the customer little or no option
but to sign on the dotted line. In

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

course of time, the tendency was
to make policies so one-sided
that an insurance company
could, if it cared to, dodge or at
least question its liability. Thus,
every statement made in the
course of buying a policy was put
down as a warranty, so that if
there was any deviation from the
truth, all of the rights of the insured could be defeated. Other
special defenses, including special periods of limitation and special modes of proof of loss, were
multiplied. This tendency to
write drastic contracts weighted
against the customer is by no
means limited to the business of
insurance. It has occurred in the
history of bills of lading and
many other fundamental contracts on which important businesses are based. Eventually in
such cases the courts and the
legislatures step in to protect the
customer. In the case of the insurance companies, legislation
has produced in most of our
states a standard series of policies, and litigation has developed
a principle of interpreting all
doubtful phrases most strictly
against the insurance company.
(2) WEEDING OUT OF IRRESPONSIBLE INSURANCE COMPANIES. Another phase of public
interest in the insurance company has as its objective the
weeding out of irresponsible
companies and the prevention of
practices likely to impair solvency. Under the laws of most
states, insurance commissioners
are appointed who exercise a
broad discretion in the matter of
granting licenses to engage in
the business of insurance. Many
of these laws are supplemented
by the requirement of a minimum
capital and a deposit of securities with state officials for the
protection of interests of citizens. Furthermore, there is exercised control over the investment policy of insurance companies. Constant inspection is pro-

vided for, and liquidation by a
public officer is compulsory
where an insurance company has
failed to maintain the margin of
safety required by law.

(1) MAKING OF RATES. The
central interest of the state is in
rates, and a great deal of law has
grown up governing the making
of rates. Theoretically, the object
of this legislation is to give the
citizens fair rates; actually, however, the only possible basis on
which utilities have been able to
fight rates which they considered
inadequately remunerative has
been to allege in court that their
constitutional rights are jeopardized by a rate which operates
to confiscate their property without due process of law. Hence,
the eyes of the law have been

(a) Fairness of Particular
Rates. The two distinct questions
have been rather crudely related
in the procedure before commissions by using the formula of
valuation for the property devoted to the public utility, in order to find a rate base, and from
this rate base to proceed through
the mathematics of a fair return
to the answer m a rate schedule
or a particular rate. Actually there
are too many unknown quantities in this calculation from beginning to end to make it anything more than a check against
careless guessing or arbitrariness. It is quite possible, for example, that the value of a plant
has no direct relationship to the
value of the service that it renders. A cheap taxicab might give
the same service on a particular
occasion as a more expensive
one. In either case it may be
worth fifty cents to be carried
from the hotel to the station.
(b) Remuneration to the Investors. Furthermore, there may
be a socially desirable rate which
does not pay or which overpays
the investor. Thus, there may be
very good reasons why New York
City should want to hold subway
fares down to five cents, and
those reasons may be so potent
that it may be wise to have the
citizens make up deficits out of
taxes. The assumption that the
rate which gives a normal return
to investors is at the same time
both a socially desirable rate and
a rate that gauges the actual
value of the service, is a wholly
gratuitous assumption.
(2) FACTORS WHICH CONSTITUTE A PROPER RATE BASE.
Nevertheless, a vast part of pub-

www.suspicions.com

lic utility law is devoted to refinements of the question: what constitutes a proper rate base. Is it
original cost modified by depreciation, appreciation, depletion,
obsolescence and such accounting considerations? Is it the
present cost of reproduction,
modified by this and similar considerations? Is it the prudent and
defensible portion of actual investment that we should start
with? Is it present valuation arrived at by appraisal independently of all these elements?
Should earning capacity be taken
into consideration? Is goodwill in
any sense a possession of the
investors in the utility? How shall
franchises be valued? Though
there is much technical learning
put forward on all of these questions, most of it is rendered
nugatory in effect by a very
simple device on the part of commissions: whenever the finding
of a commission is set aside because of its failure to take any
one of these elements into consideration, it proceeds thereafter
to make a point of listening to
that type of evidence and proclaiming that it does take that
element into consideration. An
award of a commission which
proclaims that it has taken everything into consideration is, if
at all within the range of reason,
proof against court attack.

2. Public Utilities
Still, an insurance company
is not a public utility. It is not, in
general, required to do business
with anyone whom it considers
a bad risk. The public utility must
treat all comers alike. The insurance company generally requires
no franchise in the sense of a
special privilege in the use of
public property. Most of our public utilities, such as water works,
telephone and telegraph companies, gas and electric companies
and street railway companies, are
dependent on such franchises,
and, in accepting, them are
bound to assume special contractual relations with the state
or city. In fact, the public utility
has practically no freedom of
contract. The telephone company must render service to all
persons alike. The schedule of its
rates is that which is dictated or
at least approved by a commission. Its so-called contract is likewise a set of terms laid down for
all persons subject to such
commissions approval. Hence,
the law of public utilities is very
largely the administrative law of
the several states.

turned from the question of the
fairness of particular rates to the
entirely distinct question of the
total remuneration of the persons who have invested in the
utility.

Security of Transactions

26

1. Insecurity of Transactions
after Completion
(1) ILLEGAL SELLING OF
ANOTHERS PROPERTY. Business
involves so many risks, that it is
reasonable for the business man
to favor the removal of those
within the control of the law. One
of these is the insecurity of transactions after they have been completed. Legal tradition tends to
protect property rather than
transactions. The two ideals frequently clash. Thus, an unauthorized person sells the goods of
one innocent man to another.
The trickster has disappeared
with the purchase money. As
matters stand, one of two innocent persons must suffer. The
first proposition that confronts
us is that the goods still belong
to the original owner. He has
done nothing to authorize their
sale, nor has he misled the innocent buyer. Of course, if he has,
we may find refuge in another
maxim: where one of two innocent persons must suffer, let
it be that one who has put the
fraudulent party in a position to
defraud. But even that maxim is
a concession to the business
mans point of view. In strict law,
the ownership of the goods has
not changed hands.

(2) CAVEAT EMPTOR. The
old rule that throws the major
risk on the buyer is a hindrance
to business. The investigation it
calls for slows up the process of
negotiating and selling. The
doubt that remains after the
most complete investigation is a
source of sales resistance. When
the adverse claimant comes out
of his hiding place, the seller in
the market, who may himself be
innocent, must make good his
customers loss. Caveat emptor
in this sense, the only meaning
in which it approximately reflects
the law, is not a popular doctrine
with business men. The general
rule of the common law, we are
told, is that every man dealing
with another in reference to
property that other may have in
his possession, must take care,
caveat emptor. The property may
be stolen, or borrowed, or
pledged, or in the possession of
a bailee for some specific purpose, and if so, the party in possession can convey no better or
further right than he has himself.1 The owner of a thing or of
any interest in the thing could,
according to this theory, follow
it wherever it was taken and
claim it against the holder for the
time being, regardless of the conditions under which he had got-

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

ten it, regardless of the hardship
thereby inflicted. A purchaser
could acquire no greater rights
than his vendor possessed. This
dogma was put forward as a kind
of law of nature, and Latin was
invoked against those who questioned it. Nemo plus juris ad
alienum transferre potest quam
ipse habet.2 In fact, even after
the innocent stranger had parted
with the tainted property, the
owner could complain of the conversion and sue him in tort.3 It
was worse than the Imp in the
Bottle. Let us examine in some
detail the process by which the
law eventually destroyed the barrier to every business transaction
implied in these ancient theories.
(3) LIMITATION ON RIGHTS
AND POWERS OF OWNER OVER
INNOCENT POSSESSOR. The earliest limitations on the rights and
powers of an owner as against a
peaceful and innocent possessor
are procedural. The right of recaption (self-help) was limited to
fresh pursuit and eventually
lost altogether.4 The right even
to restitution through court help
has been limited by a series of
statutes of limitation. On a procedural basis, too, was worked
out a theory that served as a doctrine of accession. Common

which has its counterpart in
other systems, seems never to
have taken root in America. We
have no thieves market where
titles may be purified for buyers.
On the other hand, we did, more
or less unconsciously, take over
a notion that benefits sellers
namely, that money has no earmarks.7 Likewise, we took over
another exception to the doctrine that one cannot give more
than he owns for the benefit of
tradesmen rather than buyers,
the doctrine that a wrongdoer
can give an effective lien on the
goods of another to an innkeeper.8 Surely American law
begins with no particular bias in
favor of buyers.
2. Principles
of the Law of Transactions
Five principles, however, that
have their germs in the early law,
have been allowed to develop so
as to reverse this condition since
the American Revolution:
(1) The first is negotiability
and its extensions.
(2) The second is agency and
its extensions.
(3) The third is rather a limitation of a growing principle
that voidable titles cannot be set
aside so as to interfere with the
intervening right of innocent
strangers.
(4) The fourth is a corollary
of our public registration of
documents.
(5) The fifth is hardly a principleit is the tendency to create a strong or irrebuttable presumption of the regularity of acts
in the ordinary course of business, and perhaps an opposite
presumption as to acts inconsistent with business usage.
Let us examine briefly the
bearing of each of these on the
position of a buyer in modern
business:
(1) NEGOTIABILITY OF INSTRUMENTS AND ITS EXTENSIONS. In negotiable instru-

www.suspicions.com

ments we have the extreme form
of the merchants rejection of the
notion that one cannot sell a
better title than he has. However
we undertake to make a reconciliation of the attitude of the law
merchant with the common
lawwhether we say negotiation
cuts off equities, or that it makes
presumptions absolute, or that
it excludes personal defenses, or
that the man who voluntarily
puts such a document into circulation impliedly consents to
this or thatthe simple fact is
that the law of negotiable instruments provides that a man can
sell a better title than he has. We
are too apt to overlook the revolutionary nature of this innovation when we try to explain the
resistance to the introduction
and extension of the doctrine in
England until Mansfields day. On
the other hand, we are likely to
misunderstand the obstinacy of
the merchants of Lombard Street
which finally triumphed. As a
practical matter, a foreign document which could be assigned
only subject to all the facts of the
case and thus could not be taken
as telling its whole story on its
face, could not be taken at all.
In recent times the principle
that a better title than a particular seller has to a negotiable instrument can be sold, has appealed to the business world to
such a degree that it has sought
to extend it to an increasing
range of transactions. It endeavored to make its corporate bonds
follow the form and come within
the principles of promissory
notes.9 It dealt with stock certificates much as it did with
bonds, and, after attempting to
make them as nearly negotiable
as possible by what it printed on
them, succeeded eventually in
having legislation passed in
many jurisdictions to make them
actually negotiable.10 More important, however, for our present
purpose is the legislation making documents of title, ware-

Suspicions News Magazine

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

sense requires the concession
that a thing may, for legal purposes, be deemed to have been
destroyed when it has been
hopelessly imbedded into something else or converted into another substance.5 Hard as that
line is to draw, once it is drawn
the legal consequences of destruction may be visited on the
man guilty of making the destructive accession, but the
goods may not be reclaimed from
him nor followed into the hands
of a purchaser from him. A few
other situations arose in odd
places in the law in which a man
could buy goods and resist any
claim on the part of a former
owner who had not consented to
their saleas when a new title
was created by a judicial sale in
rem, a forfeiture, bankruptcy,
marriage, intestacy, or where the
law for very good reasons empowered an officer or appointee
to act instead of an owner for the
conveyance of that owners title.
In none of these situations was
there any thought of serving the
need of modern business of making transactions stand even as
against outraged ownership
but by furnishing prototypes in
which the theory of ownership
yielded and transactions stood,
they became extremely important eventually when a motive
emerged for striking a new balance between the sanctity of
ownership and the importance of
upholding transactions.
The first limitation on ownership in English law based substantially on the business considerations in favor of the security
of transactions was probably the
doctrine of market overt.6 The
idea seems to have been that if
a thing was exposed and sold in
a market overt in the ordinary
course of business, the buyer
took a clear title. The transaction
was not only good between the
parties but also binding on all
those who had any right or property in the goods sold. This law,

27

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

house receipts,11 and bills of
lading,12 when properly drawn,
negotiable. Negotiable instruments familiarized the business
world and the lawyer with several concepts such as due
course, bona fide purchaser for
value without notice, as well as
with the general idea of the security of a transaction, and these
ideas were found useful eventually in connection with the other
principles that came more directly to the aid of buyers.

28

(2) AGENCY AND ITS EXTENSIONS. Agency in its strict sense
and narrower applications is, of
course, no illustration of the extension of any special favor to
buyers. It is only when, by a liberal interpretation of apparent
scope in the light of the ordinary
course of business, an agent of
a dealer is clothed with powers
beyond his authorization, that
the buyer is benefited. The principle is not different in theory
from that which would equally
benefit sellers or other contracting parties under similar circumstances. In practice, however,
buyers are very important beneficiaries of this principle. Not
only are they entitled to assume
the ordinary powers of warranty
in the agents with whom they
deal, but also the power to sell
the things in their possession- so
far as consistent with the ordinary course of the trade.13 There
is, however, a further extension
of the principle which makes it
possible in an increasing variety
of cases to treat a person to
whose possession goods have
been entrusted as an agent to
sell by reason of the holding
out, though in fact he is not an
agent at all.14 This quasi-agency
has been technically built up on
the basis of estoppel. In fact, it
has come about in response to
the business need for the protection of buyers in the ordinary
course of business.

(3) TRANSFER TO INNOCENT
PURCHASER OF VOIDABLE TITLE
OR ONE HAVING INCUMBRANCE.
Tangible things are not negotiable. There are situations,
however, in which the holder of
a voidable title can transfer a
perfectly good title to an innocent purchaser for value. A title
acquired by fraud, duress, undue
influence, or under any other
condition in which a contract
may be set aside at the option of
the victim, may have to stand if
the rights of an innocent
stranger have intervened.15 It is
true that there is a difference in
degree between the situations in
which the fraudulent purchaser
of a horse gives a good title and
that in which the finder of a negotiable instrument, payable to
bearer, passes a good title.
Thus, where the transferor has
no title to the object the buyer
from him gets none.16 But the
conception of what constitutes
bona fides, what constitutes
value, what constitutes notice in
the conception of the bona fide
(or innocent) purchaser for value
without notice, tends to be taken
bodily from negotiable instruments law and read into the law
of dealings in goods by fraudulent owners. There has accordingly been a relaxation in
late years. Whereas formerly
some states disqualified the innocent purchaser who though
without actual notice might have
acquired knowledge,17 today the
tendency is to require the proof
of actual knowledge of the defect or such facts that his action
in taking the commodity
amounts to bad faith, before he
is disqualified from taking a better title than his seller had.18
Likewise, the value with which he
must part is anything that will
serve to support a simple contract as consideration,19 such as
a promise, or forbearance, or a
discharge of a debt. It need not
be present value. The law is very
liberal to the buyer under such

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

conditionsmore liberal, for example, than to one who buys
from a defaulting trustee.20
Where ones defect in title is
not due to its voidability, but simply to the existence of a condition or incumbrance, under the
common law theory it can be sold
only subject to the incumbrance.21 If the object had previously been mortgaged, the innocent purchaser has only his folly
to thank when it is taken from
him to satisfy the mortgage. The
same principle applies to a conditional sale or to any other arrangement whereby a creditor
has retained or acquired a legal
interest in the subject matter of
the sale. Unless something could
be done to protect an innocent
purchaser against such secret
incumbrances, all security of
transactions would disappear.
(4) RECORDING OF DOCUMENTS. As to real property the
same problem existed, though
the inconvenience of requiring a
long drawn-out investigation was
not felt as so prohibitive a burden because of the relatively
greater size and importance of
the transaction. Several solutions
or partial solutions of the difficulty have found their way into
our statute books, most of which
involve a public notice, filing, or
record. If such public notice, filing, or record is neglected, the
law declares the transaction void,
or at least inoperative as to
strangers. There is considerable
diversity in recording laws as to
the strangers benefited by their
violationswhether they must
be purchasers and if so whether
judgment creditors are to be considered purchasers, whether they
must be ignorant of the prior
transaction, and so on. A difference between real estate and
personal property was discovered early in the development of
the laws of public notice. There
was no difficulty as to where the
record should be made for real

(5) PRESUMPTION OF REGULARITY OF ACTS IN BUSINESS.
The old law used to expect a
great deal from the man on the
street. He was not only expected
to be circumspect, to examine
the title and quality of everything
he bought, but he was expected
to know a good deal about the
corporations with which he dealt.
He was supposed to make sure
that they existed according to
law, that they had the power to
do that which they undertook,
and that the officers through
whom they acted were the duly
constituted officers. A bank dealing with a corporation can and
does demand evidence for its
records of all these things. The
ordinary customer of the corporation does not and cannot. In
the early days of the use of the
corporation in private business
there was a possibility at one
time that the doctrine of ultra
vires would be so applied as to
hamper the usefulness of the
corporate form in business. But
gradually the whole doctrine began to fade out of the picture. A
legal necessity for a technical
investigation at the threshold of
each of the hundreds of contracts made in a modem business day is an intolerable burden.

Blackstone founds accession

been supposed to have been
taken from Roman law (bk. 2, cc. 2
and 3). See Pulcifer v. Page, 32 Me.

values, however, which has been
widely applied in this country,
differs quite radically from the test
of change of species of the Roman
law, and the injection of a distinction against a willful trespasser
goes to distinguish the AngloAmerican doctrine of accession
from that of the Romans.

estate, as the land could never
be moved out of the county. But
suppose a public notice was effected as to a chattel mortgage
on a piano in Buffalo, New York,
and that piano was wrongfully
sold while the mortgage was
unsatisfied, in Cleveland, Ohio,
to an innocent purchaser. In such
a case it was held that the mortgagee had done all that the law
required him to do and that the
doctrine of caveat emptor would
apply. 22 In other words, the
buyer is not so effectively protected in the case of personal
property as he is in the case of
real estate, though the devices
adopted for his protection are
similar. This is particularly noticeable in the case of automobiles. They are very commonly
incumbered with chattel mortgages or conditional sales, and
yet they are so easily moved from
county to county and state to
state that the chattel mortgage
list in some remote county is certainly no protection to a prospective buyer. Consequently, we
hear. suggestions as to national
recording for automobile encumbrances, or checks on the transfer of automobiles through the
official issuing of licenses, and
even the requirements of formalities and public notice subject to
penalties, in connection with every sale of a car. The problem is
not solved, but it seems to be
taken for granted that a simple
return to caveat emptor is not a
satisfactory solution. We may
have to put the buyer to some
trouble in the examination of
records, and we may have to
leave him subject to some
chance, but we take it for granted
that the law should be relied on
to devise some means for making the buyer of personal property as well as real estate, of used
articles as well as new ones, reasonably safe against incumbrances.

Chapter V

Business Property

2. Protection
of Business Property
The interests which the law
recognizes and protects in physi-

cal things, both movable and
immovable. are the subject of
another volume in this series.1
Subject to some limitations indicated in the last chapter, the
rules of property law that have
grown up outside of business
must suffice for business. When
we turn to the intangible values,
however, we are confronted with
some new types of property or
quasi-property for which business insistently demands and
the law reluctantly accords recognition. Of course, it makes
little difference to the business
man whether you accord the
name property to his goodwill,
his trade-marks, trade names,
secret formulae, advantage of
having a going concern, advantageous contract, established
labor relations and other similar
advantages, and even his nuisance values. He is very much
concerned, however, in the manner in which the law protects
such interests from subtle attacks, in the manner of his being taxed because of them, in the
question of their transferability
either in gross or in connection
with property in tangible things,
and in what facilities the law furnishes for staking out, recording,
publishing and perpetuating
such interests. To put the matter another way, the reason these
interests are treated in certain
ways is not that they are or are

www.suspicions.com

not property. On the contrary,
they become or fail to become
essentially like property because
of the way they are treated.
(1) TRADE-MARKS AND TRADE
NAMES. We have, in an-other connection, already considered the
nature of the protection accorded
true trade-marks and trade names,
and also the similar protection
against unfair competition accorded trade symbols that fall
short of the technical requirements of trade-marks and
trade names. The influence of the
property idea is seen, however, in
the different rules of damages allowed for infringement and for
unfair competition where there is
no infringement. In the case of the
American Girl Shoe2 much turned
on this question. If this name were
taken to be fanciful, a full accounting of the profits of the defendant
would have to be made, whether
he sold to new customers or to
the old customers or the plaintiff.
If, however, the term were taken
to be geographical and descriptive
the offender would be answerable
only for the loss suffered by his
competitor, the plaintiff. The difference was considerable. Fortunately for the plaintiff, the full
trade-mark included a picture of
an American girl, and for this and
other reasons the court leaned to
the conclusion that the name was
a fanciful one.

1. Business Property
Defined
When the business man lists
his assets for a financial statement, he is not exactly making
an inventory of his property in
the legal sense of the word. The
traditions of accounting require
him to list a combination of past
and present facts and guesses
together with some future hopes
and with adjustments based on
averages or estimated averages,
and the result of the calculation
yields a purely artificial surplus.
The practice serves some practical purposes. Linking the plant
figure to original costs and allowing depreciation on the basis of
approved averages prevents the
introduction of entirely fantastic
figures. When an expense such
as taxes has been incurred and
the amount is unknown, a guess
must be allowed for reserves. Receivables, as well as goodwill,
are, like faith, necessarily the
substance of things hoped for.
But behind this list may be discerned the elements of value, the
legal rights in which we may call
property. Some of these elements are in land and buildings,
some in movable tangible goods,
some in intangibles.

(2) EXISTING CONTRACTS. A
mans reasonable expectation
that strangers will not induce
breaches of his existing contracts is an intangible interest
now fully protected by law. This
rule had its humble beginnings
in the cases of interfering with
or enticing ones servants. It
gained clarity from the famous
case of Lumley v. Gye3 in which
two London music hall owners
clashed over the attempt of one
to induce a singer to jump her
contract with the other. It has
since had many repercussions in
the growing law of labor relations, boycotts, and unfair competition. The rule does not insist
that the contract be formal or of
stated duration. In fact, it has
been extended to cover cases
where a contract was only in contemplation, and therefore, by
another step, to the protection
of goodwill in general.

(3) PROTECTION OF GOODWILL. (a) Definition of Goodwill.
Goodwill has been variously defined. To the accountant it is apt
to mean a capitalization calculated to represent the invisible
source of otherwise unexplained
surplus of earnings over the average in comparable industries.
From this point of view a business with average earnings has
no goodwill, and one that is losing money has, if anything, a
negative goodwill. But to the
business man it is quite evident
that even the business which is
losing money may have certain
intangible, invisible and
imponderable advantages that
do not show currently in the
earnings or that show in the form
of a diminution of losses. Occasionally he calls on the lawyer
to phrase such advantages in
appropriate form for purposes of
transfer. The lawyer is apt to begin with a concept of goodwill
which likens it to the beaten path
to ones business door. In fact,
when this expression was first

used in the law books it was no
mere figure of speech. Goodwill
was associated with a specific
place. It was a kind of secondary
interest in land. Hence, there still
lingers the idea that it cannot be
sold without some interest in
land. This concept is not adequate to explain the facts of
business. The goodwill of a
professional man will follow him
from office to office, as he moves.
The owner of a route for hawking or milk delivery or service
may be landless. Even a local
store can move about considerably within a city without losing
its identity or its patronage. A
chain-store may have a beaten
track, on the basis of other
stores in the system, the moment
it opens its doors in a new neighborhood.
(b) Agreements in the Sale
of a Business or Practice. Let us
analyze what takes place when a
doctor or lawyer undertakes to
sell his practice. In the first
place he probably agrees to introduce his successor to his clientele, or to permit his successor to so introduce himself. He
may actually hand over his lease
and assign other useful contracts. He may deposit his
records with the new man. He
may consent to the transfer of
his telephone number. He probably will agree not to compete
directly or indirectly with his successor or to interfere with the
reasonable attempts of his successor to take his professional
place. A similar set of agreements may very easily be conceived of in connection with the
sale of a business. In fact, the law
had occasion to analyze the sale
of the goodwill of a business long
before it was able to dissociate
the idea from real estate. It had
to decide, for example, whether
a sale of goodwill implied, in the
absence of specification, an
agreement not to compete, and
it leaned quite naturally to the

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

view that no such agreement was
implied. It is, therefore, necessary in drawing agreements for
the transfer of such intangible
interests to describe fully what
each side undertakes without
relying too much on the denotation or connotation of such
words as goodwill, route,
practice, and their approximate
equivalents.
(c) Agreement Not to Compete. Another handicap that the
law has imposed on efforts to
traffic in goodwill grows out of
the theory that an agreement not
to compete or not to engage in
the trade or profession for which
one has been trained, is against
public policy. The older cases
followed this theory. Eventually,
escapes were found by distinguishing between those agreements unlimited in time and
space and those which were limited. An actual examination of
the decisions shows that a failure to limit time made little or
no difference so long as the
space was limited. Some odd
practices developed under this
mechanical rule, such as agreements not to compete except in
some out-of-the-way spot or
some unlikely state or country.
Finally the modern rule was
evolved: that in every case the
reasonableness of the restraint
in view of the legitimate end to
be accomplished must be the
test of validity.4
(d) Protection of Goodwill
from Agent or Employee. In contrast to the reluctance of the law
in facilitating the transfer of
goodwill and in protecting it
against onslaughts from without,
stands the alertness of the law
to protect it against attacks from
within an organization. Ones
agent owes the highest degree
of loyalty and fidelity. This duty
is interpreted as including the
renunciation of any advantage
inconsistent with the interests of

the employer; it extends beyond
the time of the termination of the
agency, for the former employee
is not free to utilize confidential
information, or other similar advantage received while in the
employ of his principal, in competition with that principal either
on his own behalf or on behalf
of a new employer. The fiduciary
quality of the relationship invites
the ready intervention of the
courts of equity. Such a court will
enjoin not only the agent or
former agent from wrongfully
utilizing his advantage, but also
those conniving with him. Injunctions have protected trade secrets and trade lists, and prevented the solicitation of customers of the former employer.5 At
times there is a difficulty raised
in deciding whether the goodwill
involved really belongs to the
agent or to his employer. Consequently we occasionally see not
only specifications in contracts
on the subject, but ingenious
efforts to direct the development
of goodwill. A bond house, for
example, in its desire to build up
a regular clientele, may adopt
rules and practices calculated to
make the customer feel that he
is the customer of the house and
not of the salesman.

(4) INTANGIBLES AS BUSINESS
ASSETS. (a) Recognition by Law.
Undoubtedly the laws recognition of intangibles as a kind of

www.suspicions.com

property has been accelerated by
the desire of the state to make
them bear a share of the property tax load. The methods employed have varied widely. At one
time the prevailing method was
merely to list on the tax duplicate such intangibles as claims,
whether evidenced by writing or
not, whether secured by mortgage or not, whether in the
readily available form of bank
deposits or in the more entangling combinations of shares of
stock, corporate bonds, or beneficial interests in trusts or business ventures. This system was
unsatisfactory because under it
concealment was so easy and so
generally connived at that scandalously small returns came in.
Furthermore, it permitted the
total escape of other important
types of intangibles, such as
goodwill. Eventually, elaborate
schedules were worked out to
get at the intangibles of business. Massachusetts, for example, led the way with a system
for taxing corporations under
which the total net value of the
corporation minus the value of
the tangible property taxed was
looked upon as the intangible
value, to be taxed as such. The
coming of income taxes, both
state and Federal, has tended to
shift emphasis from taxes on intangibles.
(b) Situs for Taxation of Intangibles. Nevertheless, nice legal questions still arise as to the
situs for taxation of various kinds
of intangible property. The law
began its attack by relying on the
maxim mobilia sequuntur personam, a maxim originally intended to cover tangible movable
property, but eventually found
too cumbersome a fiction for its
original purpose. Hence, much
learning was devoted to such
questions as the situs of a debt
or, rather, of a claim based upon
a debt, the situs of a share of
stock, or the sit us of a bank ac-

(e) Protection from the
Middleman; Refills. The coming
of the middleman into business
has created some new problems,
which the law has not yet solved,
in the protection of the goodwill
of the manufacturer. His legal
inability to impose restraining
conditions on the power of the
middleman to sell his goods has
frequently placed his reputation
at the mercy of the careless or
unscrupulous dealer. A long debate has only recently come to
an end as to whether it hurts the
reputation of goods to use them
as loss leaders or otherwise cut
their prices. With the upholding
by the Supreme Court of the
United States of the Fair Trade

Acts of California and Illinois,6
and the adoption of similar acts
by forty-one other states and the
United States Congress,7 it is
now possible at last for the
manufacturer to control the retail sales price of his branded
goods. But he is still battling with
the middleman who finds it more
profitable to sell non-genuine
parts or refills for machines of
various kinds. Unless a very
good case is made out, such an
attempt on the part of the manufacturer looks like full line forcing, a recognized variety of unfair competition. He is waging a
losing battle with the substituter
who openly recommends substitution, especially under the impact of the price maintenance
laws. In his effort to prevent his
packages from being refilled, he
has called in not only the aid of
the inventor (with non-refillable
bottles for beverages and lubricating oil), but also of the legislator who lays down penalties on
the misuse of milk bottles, or of
the courts which once enjoined
the refilling of containers marked
Prest-o-lite with other makes of
acetylene gas8 and now insist
that the shells of Champion
Spark Plugs shall have every vestige of their original makers
identity sand-blasted off before
they are sold after being reconditioned.9 To get the full protection of labeling, the manufacturer announces that his product is never sold in bulk. When
it is sold in bulk or is rebottled
or packaged by the middleman,
trouble and recrimination of another sort arise. The courts are
called on to prevent or at least
regulate the use of the name of
a perfume-maker on what purports to be his own product in
packages and combinations that
are not his.10

count. The logical answer, at the
home (or perhaps on the person)
of the owner, though it served
as the basis of important constitutional decisions in its time,
became less and less realistic as
the indicia of such claims came
to be looked upon more and
more as things. Consider, for
example, the history of the stock
certificate. A century ago it was
apparently so unimportant that
none was generally given to the
stockholder. The evidence of his
ownership was in the books of
the company. If for any reason
he wanted a certificate, a simple
writing was given to him which
was precisely what the name indicates: a statement by the
proper official of certification to
whom it might concern that John
Doe was on a certain day the
owner of so many shares of the
capital stock of the company.
Whatever satisfaction, profit or
standing this certificate gave
John Doe, it did not enable him
to consummate a sale of his interest without applying at the
office of the company. He might
lose or destroy his certificate
without endangering his position. In fact, there is every reason to suppose he could easily
procure another, and probably
would have to get another if
proof of his ownership at a later
date became desirable. As larger
corporations developed, it became customaryit is hard to
say whento issue a certificate
to every stockholder, and business men began to regard these
tokens as something that ought
to pass from hand to hand with
proper endorsements on sale of
the stock. They stood for the
stock. Eventually they were made
practically negotiable by statute.
Transactions could be based
upon their physical presence as
the subject matter of pledges,
exchanges, sales. The record in
the books of the company,
though still important for certain
company purposes, becomes

secondary so far as dealings between other parties are concerned. Under these circumstances it becomes easy for a
resident of New Orleans to leave
his securities in the hands of
an agent in New York, where they
can be produced instantaneously
as needed for every business
purpose. It would be straining
the fiction too far to say that New
York shall not tax this property
within its borders because it is
technically not there. Ultimately,
the fiction yields to the new reality. Intangibles tend to be-come
tangibles for practical purposes.
(c) Valuation of Intangibles.
In the famous Adams Express
Company case,11 Ohio was upheld in its effort to find and appraise intangibles within the
state. The total value of the express companys business was
calculated on a reasonable basis,
then the total amount of its annual business and the portion of
the business done in Ohio was
figured out. Then by the rule of
threerather than by appraising
the value of office furniture,
trucks, printed forms, leases and
other contractsthe value of the
companys property in Ohio, that
is, its going concern value, was
estimated. This experiment was
the forerunner of numerous successful attempts in other states,
and a few unsuccessful ones, to
evaluate intangibles by indirect
but perfectly clear and reasonable methods.
Of course, in order to take
account of the value of intangibles for taxation or other
purposes, it is by no means imperative that we think of intangibles as separate items. The
question of value might be attacked quite as well by regarding much that we have discussed
in this chapter as a phase of the
visible tangible property before
us. The difference between the
going concern value of a business and its junk value is no

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

more striking than the difference
in value between a live horse and
a dead one; yet no appraiser or
accountant would think of writing the life of the horse down on
a separate line beneath the horse
itself. The analogy goes a step
further: it would be as impossible
to sell going concern value separately from the business as it
would be to sell the life of the
horse to one customer and the
horse to another. The analogy
would be controlling, were it not
for our accounting practices,
many of which are ordained by
law, which make it impossible to
adjust values, once entered, by
reason of such conditions as
stoppage or acceleration of processes, or accretion of goodwill
in most of the senses in which
we have applied the term, or any
turn of luck not duly labeled in
the limited vocabulary of legal
accountancy.

MACHINERY

and Business
Every hindrance to enforcement of claims is a clog on credit;

tracts that have some time to
run, such as lessees, employers,
advance purchasers of crops. On
the other hand, those at the opposite side of each of the transactions and situations suggested
are creditors, including, to single
out only a few, the depositors in
banks, the purchasers of insurance, the bondholders, landlords
and employees under contracts.
Obviously modern business
leaves very few of us free to follow the advice of Polonius, Neither a borrower nor a lender be.
2. Action in Court
The principal burden of this
credit structure must be borne,
in the last analysis, on the assumption that the creditor can,
if necessary, bring an action in
court against the defaulting
debtor and pursue his claim to
judgment and satisfaction either
by payment or through execution of the judgment by court
officers who seize and sell the
defaulters property. There are,
to be sure, some other aids at
the disposal of the creditor that
serve as props of the credit system. In extraordinary cases, tribunals administering criminal

Credit, a very important part
of the modern business system,
is founded upon the enforcement
machinery of the law. Yet this
machinery has been but little influenced by modern business
ideas. Procedure is essentially
the same in our courts, whether
damages are sought or not;
whether we are concerned with
buying and selling or with matters so far from the workaday
world as the claim of a bishop
for having been ousted wrongfully from his seat; whether there
is an accusation of false advertising or of murder; whether equity is invoked to enjoin unfair
competition or to test the constitutionality of a new marriage
law. Procedure is thus not a distinctive part of Business Law. It
is, however, within the scope of
our purpose to study the impact
of procedural law as we find it
on Business.

every facilitation is an encouragement to its use. Legislation calculated to protect the debtor,
therefore, frequently operates as
a boomerang by preventing the
extension of credit to the prospective debtor. That we are all
at one and the same time debtors and creditors became clear
when the cheapening of the dollar was before the country as a
live issue. In general, such a process might be expected to redound to the benefit of debtors
who could wipe out their debts,
as a result, with a smaller value
(let us say in terms of food or
labor) and, accordingly, to the
detriment of creditors. Debtors
include all those who have borrowed money on their farms, all
who have bought on the installment plan, all who have run up
troublesome bills, and tenants in
arrears, to be sure; but as the
rich and powerful can borrow
more readily than the poor, by
far the greatest group of debtors are corporations with large
bond issues, the business borrower from commercial banks,
the banks themselves, insurance
companies, and prospectively all
persons at the paying end of con-

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

law, equity, bankruptcy law, administrative law, or association
rules may be feared more by the
debtor than an ordinary court
awarding damages for a simple
breach of contract. In still other
cases, as we shall see in the next
chapter, ingenious arrangements for the safeguarding of
credit may overshadow the ordinary legal procedure. Finally, in
petty credit transactions, the
probable willingness of the
debtor to pay rather than the
creditors ability to make him pay
is the basis of the extension of
credit. Consumer credit is readily
extended in cases where it is
obvious that it would not pay to
bring any action, both because
of the cost in time, money and
undesirable publicity and because liberal exemption laws
would probably render the
debtor execution-proof. Yet, after all these concessions are
made, the simple action at law
for damages for breach of contract remains the very backbone
of the credit system.

36

(1) STEPS IN PROCEDURE It
will, therefore, be worth while to
make a special examination of
some phases of this type of action here, though courts and actions at law in general are discussed more fully elsewhere in
these volumes.1 In the simplest
case, it is necessary (1) to have
the adverse party brought into
court, literally or figuratively, (2)
to have the claim and the essential facts on which it is based
stated, (3) to give the other side
an opportunity to state its side
of the case, (4) to focus the dispute in issues, whether of law
or fact, (5) to have a trial of the
issues, (6) to render judgment,
and (7) to enforce the judgment.
In addition to these essential elements, our legal tradition provides for one or more opportunities for judicial review in a higher
tribunal and for various processes in aid of execution in the

enforcement of a judgment. The
function of each of these steps
becomes painfully obvious in a
poorly planned arbitration proceeding, when the parties persist
in dragging in grievances that
merely tend to confuse the merits of the case being heard, and
the arbitrators are quite helpless
about excluding them because
no clear issue has been presented to them. On the other
hand, too rigid an adherence to
the rules of the game, as developed in the long history of
court procedure, may result in
various failures from the business mans point of view, notably excessive costs, delays, arbitrariness, and technicality, by
which he means- not only excessive fussiness about trifles, but
the actual sacrifice of the merits
of the case to a rule that seems
to have lost its sense if it ever
had any.
(2) PLEADING. The history of
pleading, by which the lawyer
means the steps in framing an
issue, is in point. A century ago,
common law pleading had developed a fine spun system of logic
which forced parties to select
single claims on a single narrow
question squeezed out under
that system. The simplification of
pleading according to various
patterns is an outstanding
achievement of nineteenth century jurisprudence in England
and America. Most jurisdictions
today call for a clear and concise
statement of the essential facts
on which a claim is basednot
the evidence of the facts nor
mere inferences drawn from the
facts, but, so far as such distinctions of degree can be made in
practice, the operating facts
themselves. The defense is to be
stared in the same way, if it is a
fact defense, so that a jury may
pass on the truth of the allegations. If the parties agree on the
facts, for the sake of argument,
a question of law may be raised

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

for the court to decide by a demurrer, the legal equivalent of
the colloquial, So what?
In petty courts of limited jurisdiction, very informal pleadings will serve the purpose, such
as oral pleadings or so-called
notice pleadings, provided judicial discretion is preserved to
demand bills of particulars when
the course of justice will thereby
be aided. Liberal delays, however, should not be granted
where there is no possible element of surprise in the revelations of such a bill of particulars.
(3) THE JURY. The traditional
fact-finding tribunal of the common law courts, for both criminal and civil cases, is the jury.
The literature in praise of the jury
system is vast and venerable;
that against it, somewhat meager and recent. It is gratuitously
described as a bulwark of the
Anglo-Saxon liberties, though
the Anglo-Saxons had never
heard of it. When it was introduced in England by the Conqueror, it looked very much like
the Inquisition, with which it
was, in fact, historically identical
It was based on the Kings royal
prerogative to force subjects
under oath to tell him the truth,
particularly unpleasant truths
about one another. It was used
in the compilation of Doomsday
Book, the record devised to give
the King all of his feudal dues
from every manor. A century later
it reappears as the Grand Jury, a
group of citizens sworn to tell the
King all the gossip that might
lead to prosecutions. It appears
in court as a fact-finding device,
lent by the King, for a consideration, of course, some time after
the Fourth Lateran Council of the
Roman Catholic Church forbids
priests to lend their aid to
magico-religious trial by ordeal,
1215. It had nothing to do with
the feudal judgment of ones
peers mentioned in the contemporary Magna Carta. It was not

(4) EVIDENCE. (a) Three Principles. Out of the peculiarities of
our jury system grows our law of
evidence. The voluminous works
of Greenleaf a century ago and
Wigmore of our own day, to say
nothing of Fletchers Encyclopedia of the Law of Evidence, supplemented by the quarrels we hear
in the court room over the exclusion of bits of evidence and the
large percentage of reversals in
higher courts on the basis of errors in the law of evidence, are
calculated to inspire the lawyer as
well as the layman with awe in

contemplation of this esoteric
system of logic. It is no wonder
that legislatures write into the
laws governing administrative tribunals and arbitrators that they
shall not be governed by technical rules of evidence. And yet the
whole system is built on only
three principles, all of which are
alluded to every time a lawyer
objects: Incompetent, irrelevant
and immaterial. Two of these
principles should give the layman
very little trouble. What is irrelevant is a question of logic. What
is immaterial, though remotely
relevant, is a question of common
sense. What is incompetent is a
question of law.
(b) The Principle of Competency. Hearsay, for example, may
be both relevant and material.
We rely upon it every day in the
most important affairs of life. Yet
the law keeps it from the ears of
the jury because it is not comparable, for court purposes, to testimony under oath, subject to the
great corrective of cross-examination. What makes the books on
Evidence so voluminous is the
exceptions and apparent exceptions to the hearsay rule. The
business world is interested in
many of these exceptions: the
admissibility of books of account
and other business records, the
use of public records, the functions and limitations of expert
testimony, the question as to
what words in a transaction are
part of the res gestae, what constitutes an admission against
interest, and so on. Business
men would, in general, throw the
weight of their influence in favor
of more liberal exceptions to the
hearsay rule. They never resent
the discrepancy between their
way of doing things and the
courts more than when challenged on the witness stand with
what sounds like the comedians
poser: Were you there ?
Some other rules under the
competency principle fare a little

www.suspicions.com

better in the opinion of the business man. The rule that calls for
the best evidence, such as originals instead of copies, is entirely
acceptable provided it permits
the use of the next best evidence
for what it is worth when a foundation is laid by giving a reasonable excuse for the non-appearance of the better type of evidence, and provided, further, no
nonsense is indulged in about
the first note made by a clerk
being better evidence than the
first permanent record made in
the ordinary course of business.
So there is little opposition
to the rule excluding certain
types of witnesses for reasons of
public policy: the religious confessor or the husband or wife in
certain cases. In general, modern
law does not exclude, as the
older law did, parties or other
interested persons, for fear they
will commit perjury. It listens to
them and takes their interest
into consideration in passing on
their credibility. The principle of
competency has been toned
down to meet the understandings of the layman. Yet, one
still hears too frequently from
witnesses: Every time I began to
tell what I knew one of the lawyers objected and the judge
stopped me.
3. Slow Legal Procedure
(1) ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES. The tradition of
our law that gives a man not only
a day in court but two or three
opportunities to be heard is
tinged, like much of our procedure, with the philosophy of a
much slower moving era than
that in which we live. There are
justifications for proceeding
slowly, deliberately, thoroughly,
in that small percentage of disputes that reach the courts, for
the outcome must serve as a
yardstick for innumerable similar transactions. Yet inequalities
arise from the power of the rich
to keep or threaten to keep a

even a fact-finding body for
nearly three centuriesit was
only a fact-declaring body, a
group of sworn witnesses rather
than sworn judges of fact. But it
did, in course of time, serve its
function well. It not only found
facts of the kind entrusted to it
efficiently, but bravely and independently. It always injected into
the administration of justice an
element of common sense that
frequently saved the law in action from the effects of the folly
of legislatures. It has served as a
training school of citizenship. On
the other hand, the system of calling in, qualifying and swearing
twelve men who know nothing
about a case and are not interested in it, in order to pass on a
question of fact, is obviously cumbersome and expensive. If the fact
is one beyond the ken of the ordinary man, if it involves business
practices, figures, modern machinery, and the choice and application of standards of due care,
ordinary prudence, proper vigilance, customary precautions,
reasonable time and reasonableness in general, doubts may be
expressed as to its fitness for its
novel tasks, however infallible it
might be in sensing where the
blame lies in a street brawl. Finally, juries have prejudices and
are not always beyond being
reached and fixed, or swayed
by resourceful lawyers.

37

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

case in court beyond the endurance of the poor, whereas the
poor man who loses a case in a
lower court is practically precluded by the expense from carrying it higher. There are many
situations in business in which
any decision is better than no decision, and a prompt rough decision is better than a meticulously
accurate one coming several
years too late. Mercantile courts
were noted for their speed in the
Middle Ages, as Cokes amusing
attempt to explain the name of
the Pie-Powders Courts reminds
us. He says that, in these courts,
justice was dispensed as rapidly
as dust is shaken from the foot.
Incidentally, the same Lord Coke
explains our whole system of
appellate jurisdiction as traceable to the Law-Giver Moses.
However valuable the system
may be, particularly if limited to
one trial and one review in ordinary cases, it is apt to be a hindrance in the simple cases on
which the credit system is based.

(2) CUMBERSOME MACHINERY FOR COLLECTING JUDGMENTS. (a) Exemptions. Another
source of dissatisfaction with the
law is the cumbersomeness of
the machinery for collecting
judgments. Leniency with debtors has a good social basis. The
civilized world has passed beyond the imprisonment of unfortunate debtors pictured in the
novels of Dickens. It has, too,
recognized the importance of
preserving the self-respect of the
individual and the integrity of the
family through making some
property execution-proof. In
some places these exemptions
are so liberal that the whole
credit system must either be rebuilt on an artificial basis or
abandoned for the ordinary citizen. Of course, by hiding behind
a corporate entity, even the small
business can create additional
exemptions for itself.

(b) Bankruptcy. The Federal
Bankruptcy Law, with its recent
amendments, sets still other
practical limits to the collection
of debts. The procedural details
and other safeguards against
abuse are too technical and too
subject to change to warrant inclusion here, but the principle of
modern bankruptcy is clear: the
honest debtor who surrenders all
his property to the court for administration for the benefit of his
creditors can have his debts discharged and begin again with a
clean slate. This idea differs in
almost every detail from bankruptcy as it was understood in
the Middle Ages. The thought
then was rather to punish the
debtor than to discharge him; to
protect creditors rather than to
salvage debtors; it was allied to
criminal law rather than to the
administration of estates; it was
always involuntary, and it applied
only to traders. The recent
amendments further emphasize
the rehabilitation motive and
yield reorganization facilities
rather than bankruptcy in the
traditional sense. Yet the evolution of the new conceptions of
bankruptcy have been so gradual
and natural that it is generally
believed the courts will find
ample justification for this legislation by Congress in the Constitutional Clause that gives it
the power to make uniform the
law of bankruptcies throughout
the United States.
4. To Make Obligations
Secure
To escape the uncertainties
of procedure and to make obligations, particularly credit obligations, more secure, business
men have resorted to three types
of arrangements:
(1) Contractual modification
of the details of procedural law.
(2) Resort to arbitration.
(3) The special devices for
safeguarding credit, which are
the subject of the next chapter.

(1) CONTRACTURAL MODIFICATION OF PROCEDURAL LAW.
A generation ago courts were
denying the power of contracting
parties to interfere with the procedure of courts. They frowned
on arbitration agreements which
tended to oust the court of its
jurisdiction. They resisted attempts to state in advance the
amount to be paid to the injured
party in case of a breach. They
declared void any stipulation that
a particular document shall be
taken as conclusive evidence.
Business men were reminded
that they could not emancipate
themselves from the rules of evidence or the statute of frauds or
the statute of limitations which
were not of their own making nor
written for their own convenience. Nevertheless, courts
have gradually been induced to
take a different view and to make
a distinction between those
stipulations which tend to promote the general objects of court
procedure, though they do so in
a novel way, and those which
tend in a contrary direction. They
first made a distinction between
stipulations for penalties, which
they held void, and stipulations
for liquidating damages, that is,
estimating and agreeing upon
such damages in advance, which
they held valid. They have upheld
waivers of many formalities, of
summons, of trial by jury, of appeal or other review, of exemptions within limits, and of some
defenses. They have upheld authorizations in notes and even in
leases to confess judgments on
the contracts in case of defaults.
They have recognized liberally
during litigation, and more sparingly if made in advance, stipulations as to evidence and admissions. They have recognized
reasonable curtailments of the
period of limitations. On the
other hand, they have refused to
recognize agreements to refer
disputes to one of the parties or
his nominee. They frown on

stipulations that proof of one fact
shall carry with it a conclusive
presumption as to another. They
have refused to recognize unreasonable limitations of the period
within which an action may be
brought. And some courts have
steadfastly refused to recognize
most of the waivers referred to
above.

(2) RESORT TO ARBITRATION. The legal position of arbitration has, in the period under
review, been completely
changed. The widely copied New
York (1925) statute not only
makes valid but irrevocable and
specifically enforceable agreements to arbitrate future disputes under a contract, as well
as submissions of pending disputes. These modern statutes
further permit and encourage
submission to arbitration of the
fact disputes in a case already in
court, they provide court aid for
arbitration proceedings, including the subpoenaing of witnesses, ruling on questions of
law, and the treatment of an
award properly recorded as a
judgment of the court. In general, however, these statutes are
permissive, and whether they
become widely useful or not will
depend in the first instance on
how well they are implemented
by trade associations, chambers
of commerce, and other voluntary groups, and, secondly, on
the extent to which they can cut
down the time, expense, publicity and animosity of court procedure without too great a sacrifice of the ultimate advantages
of state or nation-supported
courts.

Devices for Safeguarding
& Facilitating Credit

40

1. Fundamental Ideas in
Safeguarding Credit
Credit is older than the legal devices for credit. Consequently, from the earliest days
we find the ingenuity of the business man taxed to find ways of
making himself safe in accepting a promise to pay rather than
a payment. The pledge idea
seems to have grown among all
peoples in some such way. The
man who agreed to hand over a
cow with which he was not ready
to part, might leave his horse
instead with the understanding
that he could eventually substitute the cow. Suretyship seems
also to have grown up in this
way. A friend or relative of the
debtor was probably left in the
custody of the creditor to be redeemed by the fulfillment of the
obligation, whatever it might
have been, for which the law furnished no adequate means of
enforcement. The mortgage, at
least the English mortgage, is on
its face and perhaps was in its
origin, the transfer of ones
property to the creditor with the
understanding that the property
could be redeemed by the performance of the principal obligation.

Even after the law developed
to the point where a simple
promise, made in the course of
business, could be enforced, the
many slips between the bringing of the action and the actual
collection of the debt have
caused business men to look
around for various means of
making assurance doubly sure.
They have continued in the path
blazed for them by those early
pioneers who created in various
times and places the pledge
idea, the suretyship idea, and
the mortgage idea. Thus, there
has come into being a good deal
of contractual self-help in the
matter of credit, and various legal institutions have been
wrested from their original setting to serve the purpose of
making the creditor secure.
These include, besides the
pledge, suretyship, and mortgage already mentioned, various
applications
of
agency,
leaseholds, bailments, employment, partnership, the issuance
of corporate securities, symbolic
possession, negotiable paper,
and anything else that the ingenuity of the business man can
use as the basis for feeling safe
in extending credit or, to view it

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

from the other angle, anything
that his ingenuity can devise to
induce another to become his
creditor.
Instead, therefore, of approaching the business problem
of using the laws devices for
credit from the point of view of
the law, and studying each institution mentioned in this
hodgepodge, let us rather approach the problem of credit
from the business point of view
and refer to these institutions
only with regard to their adaptability for the purpose of safeguarding credit under various
sets of facts.
2. Credit from the Business
Point of View
From the business mans
point of view there are two bases
of credit outside of the ordinary
legal procedure for the collection
of debts: first, personal security
and, second, real security. Both
of these terms are used in their
literal senses, that is, they refer
to the simple fact that, in making a creditor more secure, we
may resort either to reliance on
an additional person or to some
thing (res) which shall be put
under the control of the creditor.

(1) PERSONAL SECURITY.
Personal security may be added
to a debt in many ways, including guaranty of several types,
suretyship, indemnity agreements, endorsement or other
signing for accommodation of
commercial paper, and del credere agency.

(b) Suretyship. Ks proposition may be varied ever so little
in words, with rather startling
legal effects. He may authorize
the giving of the goods to U, to
be charged jointly to K and U.
This we may call suretyship
though there is by no means
unanimity among law writers in
the use of this word, as some
appropriate it for what we have
called guaranty of payment. In
the situation we have described,
we simply have a contract with
two promisors on one side instead of one. Between these two
promisors the situation is thoroughly understood. If K pays any
part, U must indemnify him. If U
pays, the matter rests there. If
the promisee knows the nature
of their relation, he will have to
proceed with the same type of
caution as called for in the case
of guaranty. Changing the risk
or the burden of the surety without his consent will let him out.
(c) Endorsement or Other
Signing of Commercial Paper. K
can become a surety for U by
signing a promissory note along
with him.. Or he may sign the
note alone, making it payable to
U, and U may endorse it to the
creditor. In either case, U, as a
signer of the note, is absolutely
bound to pay and is not entitled
to the benefit of the conditions
enjoyed by the endorser whom
we have described as a con-

www.suspicions.com

ditional guarantor. In fact, the
creditor can get the benefit of
two names on a negotiable instrument, regardless of the position that the parties, for convenience, choose for their
names, subject to the requirements imposed on the creditor
by the negotiable instrument
law and the stipulations in the
document. Thus, K may appear
as one of the persons unconditionally liable (the maker of a
note or the acceptor of a bill of
exchange), or as one conditionally liable (the drawer of a bill of
exchange or the endorser of either type of instrument).
(d) Indemnity and Del Credere Agency. K may get into the
picture of Us debt in a very different way, as an insurer of a
business man against certain
credit losses, and U may be only
one of the debtors. Such a contract is one of indemnity, and is
subject to the laws of insurance.
Again, K may be an agent selling the goods of D on credit to
a group of customers chosen
and approved by K, with the understanding that he is to be responsible for U as one of these
customers. K is then a del credere agent whom the law so far
distinguishes from a guarantor
as not to include him under the
Statute of Frauds as a person
agreeing to answer for the debt
of another.
All types of personal security have some of the weaknesses of the ordinary procedure at law because they are
enforced through it. Furthermore, in the interpretation of
these contracts there is a strong
tendency to give the benefit of
every doubt to the person who
presumably got no advantage
from the transaction. Thus, on
such questions as whether an
offer of guaranty called for a
notice of acceptance, whether
the completed contract called
for a notice of each action un-

Suspicions News Magazine

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

(a) Guaranty. These plans
may be illustrated simply by assuming that two men enter a
store together for the purpose
of buying goods for one of them.
Let us designate them as K,
standing for Known, and U,
standing for Unknown. Ks
credit is good, but his friend U
is the one who wants the goods.
K may, of course, say: Give U
the goods and send me the bill.
This transaction does not come
within any of the classes, as U
is outside of the contract altogether. But K is more likely to
say: Give U credit. If he does not
pay, I shall. This is a guaranty
of payment. It must be reduced
to writing and signed by K in
order to be binding under the
Statute of Frauds. Again, K may
say: Give U credit. If you cannot collect from him, or if he
becomes insolvent, I shall pay.
This is a guaranty of
collectibility or of solvency. It,
too, requires writing. But, obviously, in order to complete his
right of access to K, one must
do or show a great deal more
than in the case of guaranty of
payment. Guaranties may be
made conditional upon the giving of certain notices, the keeping of certain records, the exercise of diligence in various ways
and, of course, in such cases the
law insists on the fulfillment of
all conditions before it will hold
the guarantor. A simple endorsement of negotiable paper,
we shall see, carries with it such
a conditional guaranty: if demand is made on the person
primarily liable, in the right way,
at the right place, at the right

time, and he refuses to pay, and
if the requirements laid down in
the negotiable instrument law
for making a proper record and
giving notice of the facts are
complied with, the indorser will
pay. In all of these cases of guaranty, it is to be noted that there
are two contracts to pay: first,
that of the principal debtor; second, the collateral contract of
the guarantor, which must in itself satisfy all the requirements
of the laws of contract to be
complete.

der it, notice of every default,
and other precautions for the
safeguarding of the interests of
the guarantor, whether the contract was meant to cover a single
transaction or to run for a series of transactions, whether a
contract was a guaranty of payment or only a guaranty of solvency, all doubts are resolved in
favor of the guarantor. Such
strict care is enjoined for the
benefit of the guarantor, surety,
accommodation party, and others similarly situated, except
perhaps the paid surety company, and the defenses allowed
by courts in such cases at times
seem so unreasonable to business men that the use of personal security is limited in practice to comparatively few situations, and in most of these the
party secondarily liable is really
an interested party: for example,
a large stockholder of a corporation who endorses its paper, a contractor who stands
behind the subcontractor so as
to enable him to get his necessary materials, the seller of
goods who endorses his
customers trade acceptance to
his bank, the automobile dealer
who assumes a contingent liability for his customers account to
the financing company.
(2) REAL SECURITY. Real security (dependence on things)
presents an even larger variety
of frameworks for credit than
the personal arrangements already discussed. Unlike these,
which are based almost entirely
upon the contract idea, the real
security devices come from
widely scattered parts of the
lawfrom Real Property, Personal Property, Contracts, Corporations, Agency, Trusteeship,
Public Records, Negotiable
Documents of Title, and from
Mortgages, which latter is compacted of several of these and
with peculiarities of its own. We
shall, therefore, have to make

brief excursuses into remote
parts of substantive law in explanation of some of the common plans.
Let us first divide into three
classes the holds which a creditor may have on things belonging to the debtor: (a) possessory
holds, (b) title holds, and (c)
combinations of these with
other means of control.
(a) Possessory holds will include all situations in which the
actual physical control of the
property passes to or remains
in the creditor, even if, in addition, elements of the other
modes of control are included in
the plan. Here we may include
possessory liens, pledges of
things, the deposit of symbols
or documents of title or of documents carrying rights with them
as collateral security. Sub-varieties of each of these or special
contractual modifications of
them exist and can be added
without number. For our purposes the main features of their
commonly recurring forms will
suffice.
Possessory Liens. It was formerly said that liens exist by virtue of statute, by common law
or custom or by contract, but the
nineteenth century was so contract-minded that it reduced
practically all cases to contract,
express or implied, and sought
only the evidence of some of its
implications in statutes, common law, or custom. Furthermore, it was anciently assumed
that a claim under a lien was one
thing and a right of action in
contract was another, and that
the two would not coexist. But,
again, the all-pervasive theory of
contract prevailed, and liens are
now looked upon as secondary
supports for contracts in every
case.
The eighteenth century lawyer could enumerate the types
of persons who had liens and
say whether the liens were spe-

Suspicions News Magazine

cialthat is, covering only the
goods involved in the transaction out of which the charge had
grown, or generalthat is, covering newly acquired goods for
back-balances. The carrier, the
innkeeper, the repairman, the
animal trainer, and a host of others, had special liens. The wharfinger, the factor, and the packer
had general liens. The agister
lost his lien through a curious
mistake. The first printed case
on the subject was one of contract, and, therefore, the agister in that case had no lien. Two
centuries later, the courts had
forgotten the learning necessary
to explain that reasoning, and
it was dogmatically said that the
agister had no lien at common
law. This rule made generalization difficult, but finally the text
writers rose to the occasion and
laid it down thus: whoever adds
to the value of the thing entrusted to his care has the right
to hold it until he is paid for his
services. As to general liens,
they said: whoever necessarily
parts with goods in the course
of giving the service for which
they were entrusted to his care
may have a lien for his balance
on other goods of the same
owner coming into his hands.
Today we have many possessory liens created or recognized
by statute, such as the
garagemans lien, the unpaid
sellers lien, and more that are
expressly covered by contract,
such as landlords liens, stockbrokers liens, and, to jump to
another extreme, the analogous
stipulation laid down by a college that no degree will be
granted to a student until all
arrearages are paid.
A bare possessory lien is a
narrow, precarious right. In itself it carries no assurance of
payment unless or until the
debtor becomes sufficiently eager to get his goods back to be
moved to redeem them. The fact
that today the creditor may sue

banker and the broker allow
them to sell out their borrowers with or without notice, at
public or private sale, to themselves or others practically
whenever the collateral holder
becomes sufficiently alarmed to
deem such action necessary for
his own protection. They further
generally stipulate that the
thing pledged may be utilized as
security for other claims of the
pledgee against the pledgor;
that the pledgee may repledge
the collateral; that the pledgee
may, but need not, take steps
to protect the interest pledged
or permit the pledgor to take
action with reference to it when
its value is endangered by a
reorganization of the corporation issuing the security, but
that he may require the pledgor
to do so; that the pledgee shall
be free from the ordinary obligation to account to the pledgor
for any surplus realized, and
that the pledgee be free of
blame for all manner of conduct
or misconduct.
The proponents of such
drastic forms for signature have
something to say in self-defense. When security values begin to topple, quick action may
be essential not only to protect
the banks interest but also the
interests of the pledgor and of
the public whose money the
bank controls. Furthermore,
banks may be trusted not to use
thoughtlessly all the extreme
powers entrusted to them. Prudence dictates that they be
armed with powers for emergencies though such emergencies,
admittedly, rarely occur. In any
event, courts may be relied on
to put a reasonable interpretation on such documents confessedly drawn by one side and
signed on the dotted line by the
other. Finally, if there is a market quotation on the securities
pledged, there is no danger of
arbitrariness in the fixing of a
sales price, regardless of how

www.suspicions.com

the sale is made. In view of the
flood of complaints that reached
the courts after the stock crash
of 1929, it is impossible to say
that this reassurance is very
reassuring. Brokers contracts
are already the subject of study
by stock exchanges and administrative commissions, and
bankers agreements may well
be submitted to voluntary or
compulsory revision.
Documents of Title. Besides
securities in the sense of stocks
and bonds, other valuable papers, particularly documents of
title, serve as the basis of banking credit. Under widely prevailing statutes today not only bills
of lading and warehouse receipts may easily be made negotiable by making the goods
deliverable to ones order, or by
otherwise following the statute,
but practically any thing may be
covered by a negotiable document of title. The Uniform Sales
Act says: A document of title in
which it is stated that the goods
referred to therein will be delivered to the bearer, or to the order of any person named in such
document is a negotiable document of title.1 Such documents
are particularly useful in shipping goods great distances, especially in foreign trade, where
it is possible to attach the document representing the goods to
a draft (bill of exchange) to be
delivered on payment of the
draft, or in more complicated
cases to attach papers representing Cost, Insurance and
Freight (C.I.F.), exchange, collection and interest, none of which
need be paid for by the customer until the goods are available, while the bankers who
make the necessary advances
are secured by holding the papers. Longer financing of goods
in a warehouse is possible with
such paper, which enables the
bank to substitute the drawers
in its safe for a lumber room, in
the original sense of the term,

Suspicions News Magazine

on his contract leads inevitably
to some kind of procedure
whereby the lien can be utilized
to satisfy the judgment. In other
words, modern law provides differently in different jurisdictions
for some sort of foreclosure of
a possessory lien after due notice to the owner of the goods.
Generally a public sale is required and a strict accounting
is expected of the surplus
yielded by the sale over and
above the debt and the costs of
procedure. A lien of this kind is
easily lost; for example, it is forfeited if possession is given up
and does not revive on retaking
possession; it is lost if the lienholder is guilty of a conversion
of the goods, and apparently he
is guilty of a conversion if he
withholds the goods from the
owner without specifying the
lien as his reason for withholding them.
Lien law is important in a few
businesses which deal with a
constantly shifting traveling
public: carriers, innkeepers, garage-men (which take the place
of the smiths of Blackstones
day), and repairmen generally.
Pledges of Things; Collateral
Securities. The lien, with its
modern equipment for enforcement, closely resembles the
pledge, whether it be the pawn
in the pawnshop or the collateral security in the vaults of a
bank or brokerage house. There
is a thought-provoking difference between the evolution of
the pawnbrokers pledge and
the banks. The former has been
governed and standardized for
many years by the action of the
state. The latter has developed
through rather one-sided contracts written by the banks and
brokers. Hence the pawnbroker,
in order to convert his pledge
into money, must proceed step
by step in a manner calculated
to give his clients a good deal
of consideration, whereas the
pledge agreements of the

Lombards, Englands medieval
bankers, kept their pledges.

(b) Title Holds. All possessory liens suffer from one great
defect that greatly limits their
practical usefulness in business.
They withdraw the goods that
are used as the basis for credit
from use and to a great degree
from the channels of commerce.
Hence, when a floor plan of
credit is needed, that is, a plan
wherein the goods are to remain
on the floor of the dealer who is
being financed, or any plan of
consumer use while the goods
are being paid for, a title hold
must be given to the creditor,
instead of a possessory hold.
The prototype of title holds is
the real estate mortgage,
though its imitations, such as
liens on real estate, chattel
mortgages, conditional sales,
leases with privilege of purchase, trust receipts, consignment arrangements for credit
purposes, have deviated, at
times, pretty far from type. In
some cases the title is actually
transferred; in others only an incumbrance is created.

44

(c) Real Estate Mortgages.
The real estate mortgage is in
form a deed which conveys to
the creditor the property that
serves as security for credit. At
the end it recites that, if the debt
in question is paid in accordance
with an agreement, the deed
shall be null and void; otherwise,
however, it shall remain in full
force and effect. Though there
is considerable diversity in the
theory of mortgages adopted by
the several states, no Englishspeaking jurisdiction gives literal effect to this language. It
has been said rightly that no
man by the light of nature can
understand an English mortgage. The reason for the obscurity lies in the very laudable efforts of equity to mitigate the

rigor of the law by avoiding the
forfeiture which the language of
a mortgage involves. Ordinarily
the property is worth more than
the amount loaned on it, and it
would be an unfair penalty, for
failing to pay the debt on a particular day, to make the entire
property forever that of the
creditor and beyond redemption. Equity has, from an
early period, taken the view that
the true meaning of the parties
was that the property should
serve as security for the payment of the debt and nothing
else. It has, therefore, created a
special right for the delinquent
debtor, called an equity of redemption. This simply means
that even after default he can
come in and pay the amount he
owes plus interest and possibly
damages, and thereby redeem
his property. If he fails to do so
within a reasonable time, it is,
of course, desirable to provide
some means of cutting off the
equity of redemptionthat is to
say, foreclosure. The term foreclosure has been used in various jurisdictions for a large variety of procedures ranging from
formal notices, followed by a
lapse of time, to public sales
with or without judicial procedure. In general, however, the
tendency of American law is to
make it unlikely that the mortgagee can make a profit out of
the forfeiture clause in a mortgage by giving effect to the
simple language of the document and converting what was
once a mortgage into a deed.
Passing of Title. The diversity of the various jurisdictions
is illustrated chiefly in the question whether the so-called condition at the end of a mortgage
is to be looked upon as a condition precedent or a condition
subsequent to the passage of
title from the borrower to the
lender. In form it looks very
much like a condition subsequentthat is to say, it looks as

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

if title was intended to pass to
the mortgagee immediately
upon the execution of the mortgage with the expectancy that,
in the normal course of events,
it would pass back to the mortgagor. And so most of the older
jurisdictionsthe Eastern
statesseem to hold. The opposite view, which seems to prevail in the West, is that no title
passes until default or, according to some states, until foreclosure. The consequences of
this diversity of view are more
technical than substantial. Thus,
if the mortgagee is the title
holder, the mortgagor who remains in possession is pretty
clearly a tenant, and the legal
relations between the two are
viewed accordingly. If, on the
other hand, the mortgagor still
has the title, whatever he is, he
is not a tenant, and other analogies must be resorted to in
working out the relative rights
of the parties. In actual practice,
the difference is likely to be mitigated by the terms of the contract written into the mortgage
which may state rather fully the
claims that each shall have
against the other under every
imaginable set of factsin other
words, the mortgage, like many
other legal instruments, has
gone through a development
from status to contract.
Modern law views the mortgage as an incident to the debt
which it secures, whether that
debt is evidenced by a promissory note or other type of document or merely existent on the
basis of an ordinary contract.
Consequently, the holder of the
mortgage generally has the option of bringing an action on the
debt without regard to the mortgage, or of proceeding on the
basis of the mortgage, or of doing both simultaneously. Of
course, he is entitled to only one
satisfaction of his claim. If the
mortgage property brings a surplus over and above the claim

words is likely to be different in
different jurisdictions, and the
presumptions indulged in may
differ to such an extent that the
transfer of this type of interest
must be looked upon as a very
technical branch of conveyancing.
It is, of course, possible not
merely to convey the interest
that remains in a mortgagor but
also to mortgage itthat is to
say, to put a second or third
mortgage on the property. Obviously in those jurisdictions in
which the first mortgage transfers title to the mortgagee, some
other interpretation than that of
the title theory is necessary to
explain the situation of the parties to a second mortgage. It
becomes very similar to the first
mortgage in jurisdictions not
accepting the title theory. This
difference between a first and
second mortgage has led to
some curious doctrines, such as
that of tacking, under which it
is possible for a first mortgagee
to acquire a third mortgage
which, by reason of his superior
position as a title holder, becomes a part of his interest in
the land, and thereby obtain priority over a strangers second
mortgage. There is a great tendency, however, to depart from
such technical theories under
modern statutes.
In the real estate mortgage,
as in all arrangements that
merely encumber the title of
property without affecting its
temporary possession, there is
danger that a stranger dealing
with the apparent owner of the
property in possession might
find himself in competition with
the mortgage claimant. If the
strict letter of the old law is followed in such a case, the
stranger is defeated and the
owner of the secret lien prevails.
Caveat emptor. The desire of the
business world to make indefeasible transactions entered into
in the ordinary way in good faith

www.suspicions.com

has, in this case as in others already studied, been recognized
by the law and written into the
provisions for registration. The
mortgagee is expected to put
his mortgage on record where
it will be found as an encumbrance upon the property by
anyone examining the title. If he
fails to do so his mortgage is not
rendered invalid, but it is simply dealt with as if it were
fraudulent so far as innocent
strangers are concerned. The
registration laws of the several
states differ from one another
on many important points. Thus,
some allow a short period for
registration; some give the same
effect to actual notice or constructive notice that they give to
registration in saving the secret
lien; still others make the moment of registration operate mechanically as the basis of priorities claimed under registered
documents.
(d) Chattel Mortgage. By
analogy to the real estate mortgage there has developed in
more recent times the chattel
mortgage. In some states the
analogy is very close, but generally the force of business necessity, as well as the relative
simplicity of the law of transfer
of interests in things, has led to
considerable differences both in
the formality and in the operation of chattel mortgages. Thus,
it is generally true that, instead
of registration, the comparatively inexpensive and simple
expedient of filing is sufficient.
The actual document need not
be executed with the formality
of a real estate deed, but only
with that of a bill of sale or similar document for the conveyance
of an interest in personal property. On the other hand, a chattel mortgage is expected to be
comparatively short-lived and
not a part of a permanent systematic legal record of the history of the thing; hence it is

and court costs, the debtor is
entitled to an accounting. If, on
the other hand, the mortgage
property brings less than the
claim, and the action included
the entire claim, a deficiency
judgment may be given for the
balance.
Since the mortgage is merely
incidental to the debt, and since
debts, particularly those evidenced by negotiable instruments, are easily transferred
by creditors, it follows that the
law must provide in some way
for the transfer of the
mortgagees interest. The exact
formula in any state will depend,
in the first instance, on whether
the mortgagee is looked upon
as the holder of the title to the
property in question or not. In
any event, the tendency today
is to simplify the process of
transferring the mortgagees
interest, or even to look upon it
as passing, in the eyes of equity,
along with the debt where no
formal transfer has taken place.
The mortgagors interest is likewise transferable. Great caution
must be exercised, however,
that in transferring it one does
not unintentionally pass to the
purchaser of it an obligation personally to pay the entire debt.
That is to say, the mortgagor
may transfer his interest in the
land subject to the mortgage, or
he may transfer it and exact a
promise, which may be worded
in various ways, involving the
unconditional payment of the
mortgage by the purchaser of
the land or the reimbursement
of the original mortgagor if he
is compelled to pay. It is, of
course, also possible to make
the mortgagee a party to the
transaction or to leave the transaction open for him to come in
at his option and deal with the
new lender as the principal
creditor or as a surety or even
as the sole creditor with the
original mortgagor discharged.
The interpretation of the same

45

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

46

usual to demand an affidavit
renewed from time to time to the
effect that the debt is still subsisting. In many states a change
of possession at the time the
chattel mortgage is made may
serve as the equivalent of recording or filing.
There is also less likelihood
of difficulties growing out of the
title theory, because chattel
mortgages, being relatively new
and governed by statutes, are
likely to be free from the technicalities suggested by the laws
of title in real estate law. Foreclosure is usually allowed with
less formality or reliance on
court action than in the case of
real estate, but in the main the
analogies of real estate mortgage law have been followed
closelyperhaps too closelyin
the development of the concept
of the chattel mortgage.
Sale agreement. Theoretically, the conditional sale is
merely a short cut accomplishing the same end as transferring
a title to a buyer and then taking back from him a chattel
mortgage giving the seller once
more a title-hold on the goods
as security for the debt incurred
in their purchase. In practice,
however, several differences
have arisen which have required
statutory adjustment. Today a
conditional sale agreement requires filing and the other formalities of a chattel mortgage
in most jurisdictions, though, of
course, a statute speaking of a
chattel mortgage does not by
those terms include a conditional sale. The agreement is,
furthermore, likely to be ever so
much simpler than a chattel
mortgage and to leave room for
more doubts. Thus, a perfect
conditional sale is accomplished
whenever it is stipulated at the
time of the contract of sale that
title will not pass until final payment is made. A single line to
that effect, or even an oral understanding, is sufficient. The

stranger who deals with the
goods in ignorance of such an
arrangement is technically, perhaps, in a poorer position than
the stranger who deals with the
title holder in ignorance of a
chattel mortgagefor the one
acquires an unencumbered title;
the other, no title. The tendency
today, however, is to dispose of
the cases in exactly the same
way.
(e) Lease with Privilege of
Purchase. Another variation of
the mortgage idea, used both
for real estate and personal
property, is the adoption of the
form of a lease with a privilege
of purchase. Historically the
privilege of purchase in the development of this form was incidental, and the lease was exactly what it purported to be. But
when the figures are juggled so
that, after paying 5 a month as
rental for a piece of furniture
one eventually reaches a point
where by a final payment of 5
he can become the outright purchaser of the thing, or where the
same plan is worked out with
reference to a house, it becomes
clear that what we are actually
doing is to postpone the transfer of title until the final payment on the purchase is made.
In the case of real estate, no
great hardship is likely to result
from such an arrangement, because the title of record is a clear
enough warning to all outsiders
dealing with the tenant in possession. Still. courts have at
times found it necessary to point
out that such an arrangement is
in substance a sale coupled with
a purchase money mortgage.2
In the case of personal property,
however, the legal difficulties
are somewhat more intense. It
is hard to bring such arrangements within the terms of a statute requiring record for secret
liens. None the less, the tendency of both statutes and decisions is today to look to the

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

substance of all such arrangements rather than to the form.
A somewhat similar situation
arises where goods are sold on
consignment. The motive for
making such an arrangement
may have little or nothing to do
with credit, but the scheme happens to lend itself to the needs
of a floor plan of financing
traders. Under it, the dealer with
the objectsay, an automobilein his possession, is quite free
to pass a title to a purchaser.
The money which he receives,
however, is not his; it is the
money of his principal, who had
remained title holder to the object until the moment of its sale.
If the dealer becomes insolvent,
not only is the claim of the title
holder of the goods protected,
if this money can be traced, but
he is free to reclaim remaining
parts of his stock without sharing their value with other creditors.
(f) Trust Receipt. The socalled trust receipt represents a
distinct evolution of another
kind in the creation of title holds
on goods in the possession of a
debtor. It is possible, and at one
time was common in certain industries, to make an arrangement that is, in a technical
sense, one of trusteeship. The
manufacturer or finisher of
goods whose credit standing is
doubtful might be given raw
goods in return for a trust receipt in which he recites that he
is accepting the goods as
trustee with certain obligations
to see them through particular
processes and eventually to convert them into cash which will
take the place of the trust res
and as to which he will render
an accounting in the ordinary
manner of trustees. Since trust
claims are not wiped out by
bankruptcy, and trust objects
are not thrown into the general
fund of a bankrupt, and since,
moreover, the answerability of

a trustee at all stages of his work
is more marked than that of an
ordinary debtor, this arrangement, while not entirely knaveproof, has proved to be quite
satisfactory. In its later modifications, however, it has ceased
to be true trusteeship and has,
rather, created a situation in
which the processor of goods
becomes a mere bailee to whom
no title passes at any time. In
other words, the arrangement
becomes more like consignment
to which is added an obligation
to do some work on the goods
besides selling them, and it culminates not in the holding of
money as a trust res but in the
somewhat similar situation of an
agent accountable to a principal.

3. Negotiable Instruments
We have already had many
occasions to allude to negotiable instruments of various
kinds. Negotiability is one of the
bases on which we founded a
concession of the legal ideal of
security of rights in favor of the
business ideal of security of
transactions. We have seen how
the idea of negotiability has
been copied from bills of exchange and promissory notes
and has been extended to other
types of commercial documents:
bonds, stock certificates, bills of
lading, warehouse receipts, miscellaneous documents of title.
We have noted the convenience
of the form of negotiable instruments for use in creating suretyship, guaranty and other
credit combinations. A brief

www.suspicions.com

summary of the substantive law
covering these very important
business documents will conclude our chapter on legal devices for safeguarding and facilitating credit.
(1) PROMISSORY NOTES. A
promissory note is in form one
side of a contract: the agreement to pay. In Blackstones day,
by virtue of its form it received
the special recognition of the
law, even as between the parties, that it is accorded on the
Continent of Europe today. The
bargain which it represented did
not have to be established by
the ordinary Law of Contract,
including such doctrines as
consideration. The nineteenth
century, however, in England
and America, assimilated the law
of promissory notes to that of
ordinary contract, so that today
theoretically between the original parties there is no difference
between a contractual promise
evidenced by a promissory note
and any other contractual promise. The only compromise in the
situation is that the form of such
document raises a presumption
that there has been a consideration, but this presumption is
rebuttable. In like manner, the
ordinary Law of Contract has
become applicable, so far as
immediate parties are concerned, in the type of instrument
known as a bill of exchange, or
in commercial parlance as a
draft, where a request is addressed to someone named in
the instrument to pay money to
another. This request is of the
nature of an offer; the payment,
or even the promise to pay, in
accordance with the tenor of the
instrument, constitutes an acceptance of the offer, and it is
understood that there is an obligation on the part of the person making the request to reimburse the person honoring
the request.
If these documents are made

(g) Mechanics Lien. There
remains to be considered a
statutory device of prime importance in the building industries.
The so-called mechanics lien
had its chief impetus, if not its
origin, in America a century ago
in an effort to protect the interests of the laborer. It has met
and overcome several difficulties, however, in the problems
of contractors, subcontractors,
and materialmen as well as laborers, by giving them all a direct claim against the property
on which they work or into which
their materials go, instead of
limiting them to personal actions against those with whom
they have dealt directly. It has,
furthermore, given them the
equivalent of a shorthand mortgage on the property acquired
by merely filing in the proper
public office an affidavit or a
notice of claim. For practical
purposes this is a cloud on title
which the property holder must
remove by settling the account
or forcing a test of the claim in
court. As a purely statutory creation which varies in various
places and is amended in each
from time to time, it is the victim of much judicial interpreta-

tion which has frequently been
overly technical. Its law is consequently full of pitfalls for owners, purchasers, and lien claimants, particularly where the statute gives even a short retroactive effect to the act of filing the
notice. One example will suffice
to warn of the treacherous nature of these liens. Where a statute permitted the filing of a lien
within so many months after the
work was finished, an unpaid
subcontractor long after the period expired took advantage of
a property owners complaint
about some of his work. He admitted that it was not finished
and after putting a very little
finishing work on it filed his
lien for the whole of his claim,
and the courts upheld him. In
the main it may be said that the
working of the mechanics lien
laws has been of tremendous
advantage in smoothing the
path of the contractor and insuring substantial justice to all concerned in the actual process of
building. Similar statutes have
been extended here and there
to mine work and to ship building.

47

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

out in the special form that has
developed in business history
and that is now almost universally covered by statute, the
document
becomes
negotiablethat is to say, transferable and capable, while being
properly transferred, of clearing
away many of the defects or limitations that may have impaired
its value as between the original parties. Where a negotiable
instrument is negotiated, we
have an illustration of a party
selling a better title to a thing
than that which he himself possessed.
The marks of negotiability,
laid down by the statute, are:
An instrument to be negotiable must conform to the following requirements: (1) It must
be in writing and signed by the
maker or drawer; (2) must contain an unconditional promise or
order to pay a certain sum in
money; (3) must be payable on
demand, or at a fixed or determinable future time; (4) must be
payable to order or to bearer;
and, (5) where the instrument is
addressed to a drawee, he must
be named or otherwise indicated
therein with reasonable certainty.3

48

The process of negotiation
depends on whether the paper
is at any moment in a state payable to bearer or payable only
to the order of a specific person.
The endorsement in blank has
the effect of making the document payable to bearerso has
the writing in of the word
bearer or any other word
clearly not intended to be the
name of a specific person in the
original document. In such
cases, the document is negotiable by delivery. If, however,
the document is payable to a
specific person, that persons
endorsement is necessary to
accompany delivery for the purpose of negotiations. Furthermore, to constitute negotiation,

the transfer must be in ordinary
course of businessthat is, it
must be made before the maturity of the document, for value,
and to a person who has no actual notice of any defects, counter-claims or equities that would
serve as partial or complete defenses for the person primarily
liable on the paper.
When such negotiation is
completed, all possible defenses
are by no means cut off. There
are so-called real defenses which
constitute a risk even for the
buyer of a document who becomes a holder in due course.
These are principally of two
kinds: those that amount to (1)
forgery and (2) those which particular statutes as parts of the
public policy of a state set up
as final. A defense is equivalent
to (1) forgery in the sense in
which the term is used here, (a)
not merely where the signature
of the person sought to be held
has been written in by another
without his consent, but also (b)
where the document in its
present form was made up over
a genuine signature4 or (c) where
a document that had never been
completed or delivered had been
filled out and delivered and thus
made into a negotiable instrument by the misuse of a genuine signature. (2) Instances in
which a statute sets up a final
defense are those which go to
the capacity of the party to make
a contract and in some jurisdictions gambling contracts.
Most defenses are considered purely personalthat is,
they apply only between immediate parties and cannot be utilized against the holder in due
course or anyone claiming title
under him. Thus, if the document was acquired by fraud not
amounting to forgery, or if it is
found that there was no consideration for the contract, or if the
maker of the document had a
counter-claim against the person to whom he had given it, or

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

if the delivery had been incomplete or only conditional, the
defense is not available after
negotiation.
Negotiable instruments
speak a shorthand language.
When one writes his name on
the back of such a paper he is
actually signing many legal
documents. Thus, (1) there is a
receipt acknowledging the payment to him by the next holder
of the amount of money recited
in the document; (2) there is
an assignment or transfer of the
document to the next holder,
whether this was necessary for
the negotiation or not; (3) there
are certain warranties enumerated in the statute, in general
to the effect that the document
is genuine and what it purports
to be; (4) there is a series of conditional guarantiesthat is,
promises to pay if the person
primarily liable fails to do so and
the necessary legal steps are
taken properly to record that
fact and promptly to notify the
endorser.
(2) CHECKS. Checks are a
variety of draft or bill of exchange. They are drawn upon a
bank by a depositor who has
presumably left funds with the
bank in advance, or made some
other arrangement under which
the bank honors his demand.
They do not recite any particular time at which the demand is
to be made or at which payment
is expected, but by custom it is
understood that they are to be
presented forthwith in the ordinary course of business and
that, while a reasonable time is
allowed for each endorsement,
it is negligent on the part of a
holder to delay for more than
one business day the presentation of his check to a bank. For
this reason he may find that the
failure of the bank during the
course of his delay may fall upon
him.
In one respect checks are

assimilated to notes rather than
to drafts. In the case of an ordinary draft the man who signs his
name in the lower right-hand
corner, the drawer, is not the
person primarily or absolutely
liable on the document. If the
document is acceptedin the
case of a check this process is
called certificationthe acceptor is the one primarily liable,
and his position corresponds to
that of the maker whose name
is signed at the end of a promissory note. The drawer, unlike
the maker, is liable conditionally
very much as the endorser is,
and is entitled to notice in case

of default on the part of the person primarily liable or even dishonor of the document by nonacceptance on the part of the
person to whom the document
is addressed. In other words, the
drawer of an ordinary draft may
under certain conditions be discharged of all liability. In the
case of the drawer of a check,
however, his discharge is limited
only to the amount by which his
position is prejudiced through
a delay. For the rest, he remains
absolutely liable precisely as if
he had been the maker of a note
instead of the drawer of a bill of
exchange.

If we think of organization as
division of function coupled with
unification of design, we may
apply the term in business not
only to the internal structure of
a unit but also to the normal relations of that unit with other
units. When we think of this
larger aspect of business organization, we can hardly be satisfied with a lawyers list made up
of corporations, various types of
partnerships, agency, and the
business trust. On the contrary,
we must think of all elements
that are needed for the successful operation of a business unit
(the labor, the enterprise, the
capital, the land) and how they
are brought together. Or, in
terms of human relationships, we
must think of the persons who
furnish these elements and of
the basis for expecting them to
be forthcoming as they are
needed in accordance with the
plan. The vast variety of the plans
that make up modern business
organization calls not only for
reshaping the recognized legal
devices for organization, but for
drawing in from time to time various types of agreements that
may never before have been
thought of as devices for organizationfor example, leases,
mortgages, trade acceptances,

standing offers, comprehensive
sales agreements, letters of
credit, and a vast variety of nameless contracts.
1. Motives of Unification
From the executives point of
view, the particular legal form
used for the expression and enforcement of his plan is not
nearly so important as are such
practical questions as the degree
of centralization of authority and
responsibility within his unit and
in relation to other units, and the
closeness with which units are
related, ranging from complete
merger on one hand to the merest touch-and-go relation at the
other. He is, furthermore, interested in certain aspects of organization that seem desirable
from his point of view, such as
plasticity, presence of control,
absence of responsibility, and
speed, cheapness, and simplicity in the making, maintaining,
and enforcing of the relations
involved in his organization.
Let us view these executive
problems from the point of view
of a manufacturer of automobiles. The parts which he assembles may be purchased from
a manufacturer of such parts on
a hand-to-mouth basis as he
needs them. Suppose, however,

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

he desires a closer contact with
the source of his supply. He can,
of course, make more comprehensive agreements to purchase by the season or even to
purchase the entire product of a
plant. He may insert peculiar
clauses in his contracts of purchase, if he has the power, which
will give him the control that he
desires. Besides the mere detailing of specifications for the
goods, he may bargain for the
presence of his own inspectors
or other employees while the raw
materials are being produced.
His motives in seeking a closer
contact with the source of supply may be various. He may have
encountered a situation in the
market of dangerously fluctuating prices or of an inadequate
supply from time to time, or it
may be that he fears latent defects in raw materials, the presence of which cannot be detected
until serious damage is done. Or
it may simply be to win for himself the profits which he suspects
have been large in the basic industries on which he relies. It
may even be that he is in search
of a place for investing his surplus. Whatever the motive, we
may readily imagine him reaching back further and further until he owns not only lumber yards

2. Motives of Isolation
We have spoken of the motives for unification. We must not
overlook the possible motives for
isolation of the various parts of
an enterprise. Turning again to
the automobile industry, let us
recall the early stages when the
manufacturer undertook quite
incidentally to sell a few cars that

he produced, without any separate selling organization. The
market at this time was quite limited and those who purchased
cars did so very much on their
own initiative and thought of
themselves as having something
built to their order. The customers were recruited from among
the wealthy, and there was no
problem of financing purchases.
In course of time all this was
changed. The scale of production
increased rapidly and, although
the cost per car decreased, the
investment in the manufacturing
of cars became so great and the
work of selling so specialized
that a cleavage developed between the manufacturing and the
marketing of automobiles. The
burden of financing cars up to
their final sale was variously adjusted between the manufacturing and the marketing organizations. Eventually, the problem of
financing the ultimate purchaser
came up and had to be faced by
manufacturer and marketing organization alike, with the result
that financing schemes more or
less directly fostered by the automotive industry have come into
existence.
In the several stages of development sketched here, many
fine readjustments have been
necessary in the distribution of
functions within the industry as
a whole. And as plans have progressed, the law has been called
upon to furnish organization
devices that would adequately
correspond to the division of
functions planned in every emergency. In these cases the motive for isolation has been pretty
largely the splitting of financial
burdens. There may also be discerned, however, a recognition of
different types of skill requisite
in the industrial and commercial
fields. There are also very different types of risks. In the early
stages of any manufacturing industry banks are hesitant about
making loans, and the money

www.suspicions.com

necessary for the financing of
such a project is likely to come
in on some speculative basis.
New industries very generally
suffer from this aspect of money
raising, but so long as thy are
speculative they call for types of
organization facilities that divide
risks and compensate for their
assumption in accordance with
very peculiar needs in each situation. On the distribution side,
however, the risks are not so
radically different from those of
any storekeeper who has his
wares for sale. Hence, capital can
be attracted and money borrowed to cover peaks on a much
less speculative basis. Accordingly, the isolation of the units
from each other may free one
part of the industry from risks
and burdens to which the other
party is subjected.
Other motives for isolation
range from a simple bookkeeping attempt to keep accounts
separate, to a complete diversity
of identity for such purposes as
keeping a part of an enterprise
out of a foreign state. The latter
extreme, in fact, is not uncommon today. It is quite possible
for a manufacturer of rubber
goods, for example, to sell all of
his product in bulk to another
unit, a marketing organization.
This marketing organization
crosses state lines and complies
with all local requirements,
whether of law or custom or particular business conditions.
Sometimes the separate entity of
part of an organization is desirable to keep two products separate so as to avoid trading down
or confusion in the mind of the
public. A dealer in medium- to
high-grade goods, for example,
might suffer in the estimation of
the public if under his name
there also was operated an establishment in which a lower
grade of goods prevailed. There
is not necessarily any misrepresentation to the public in concealing the relationship between

Suspicions News Magazine

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

and saw mills but forests, not
only factories for the manufacture of metal parts but steel mills
and refining plants, mines, railroads, and steamship lines.
The reaching out may go forward in the other direction. The
manufacturer may acquire closer
and closer relations with the distributing and retailing end of his
business. His motives here may
be to control the conditions of
ultimate sale of his product. On
the other hand, while cultivating
a complete vertical organization
on the manufacturing end, he
may avoid the expense and risks
of marketing because for one
reason or another he may not
feel the need of controlling conditions of the market.
We have moved in two directions of the vertical development
of a unit, beginning with the
manufacturer as the center. Of
course, in the actual history of a
business we may find the retailer
occupying this central position
and working backward by acquiring the wholesale distributing
organization, or eliminating that
and acquiring the manufacturing
plant and more or less of the
structures that lie behind it. For
present purposes the principle is
the same. It is for the executives
to decide, so far as in their power
lies, how closely knit a relationship shall exist among the units
that constitute in a broad sense
the business organization of
which they are a part. It is for the
law to furnish a variety of organization devices that will delicately respond by giving exactly
the degree of unification desired.

51

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

52

two establishments by their independent organization. In fact,
such separate organization may
be one means of protecting the
public from the confusion and interchange of goods. But the line
that divides the genuine independent from the bogus independent is at times rather hard
to draw. It may happen, for example, that the New Englander
purchasing a cotton mill in the
South finds it advisable, in general, to maintain that cotton mill
as a unit distinct from his New
England interests. He may
thereby retain the local goodwill
connected with the newly acquired plant and he may avoid
jeopardizing goodwill in the
neighborhood of his original operations. It is conceivable, however, that a point may be
reached, in dealing with a local
prejudice or fear in either vicinity, in which the concealment of
the relations between the plants
takes on an active form. An extreme situation was reached in
the World War when questions
arose as to the interest of alien
enemies in American corporations. In other words, whatever
device may be found to have use
in keeping related business enterprises apart may also be subject to abuse.
The mere element of size
may, from a practical business
point of view, determine the desirability of merging or keeping
apart two related enterprises. It
has been said by the courts that
mere size unaccompanied by
unlawful acts is not a basis for
prosecution or other objection
under the anti-trust laws. Nevertheless, size, or rather the
proportionate place occupied by
a business within its field, may
be the most telling evidence in a
trust prosecution. But quite apart
from the legal implications, there
are reasons to believe that, in
particular types of industries
under particular sets of conditions, there is a most advanta-

geous size of unit, below which
there is experienced with growth
an increasing return and above
which there is experienced a
diminishing return. This optimum size must be determined in
the present state of business
study quite empirically. Eventually, principles may be discovered on the basis of which the
optimum unit may be related to
technique of management, to
local spread, to the state of the
arts involved, or to other more
or less measurable differences in
businesses. Legal limitations
may, of course, be found pertinent elements whenever such an
analysis is undertaken, and
whenever standards are discovered, either empirically or scientifically, the adjustment of units
resulting therefrom may call for
a bringing together of parts of
the business and a deliberate
separation of other parts
through the aid of legal devices
of organization.
3. Endurance
of a Business Organization
The question of duration in
business organization has undergone in recent generations a
series of kaleidoscopic changes.
Permanence, or the endurance of
a business beyond the life of its
founder, has frequently been
achieved in less dynamic environments than our own through the
handing down of business units
from father to son. In this country there are very few businesses
that have remained in that way
in a single family for three or
more generations. But a different type of endurance has been
sought and achieved through the
use of the newer types of legal
framework for organization, such
as the corporation. It is rather
curious to contemplate the headlong plunge that we have taken
from types of business organization measured by the active life
of an individual, into a type presumed to be perpetual. Statistics

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

are not yet available to show the
actual expectancy of life of business corporations, and even if
the statistics were available it
would not necessarily follow that
the corporations organized fifty
years ago for the operation of
street cars, for carriage making,
or for banking, were engaged in
the same types of activities today as those for which they had
been founded. And in view of the
power of the state to alter,
amend, or repeal the charters
and its actual use of this power
by changing the general law of
corporations which constitutes
the charters of today, it is sometimes doubtful whether the entity called the X Corporation today can fairly be identified with
the thing that bore its name and
preceded it. Some states, it is
true, make it possible to organize
a corporation for a limited period
or for a temporary purpose, and
some even set a limit to the possible duration of a corporation
engaged in a particular enterprise. It is even possible that the
psychological effect of the corporate form in making men build
for the future and plan for the
long-run has been great. But, in
general, the business world gives
little attention to the question of
duration at the time of making
its major plans of organization.
This attitude may be traceable
either to a careless disregard of
the future and a feeling that so
long as the venture pays it will
continue, or it may involve a tacit
assumption of building for the
future. No doubt there are instances of both types. The form
of organization to which one
man thoughtfully turns in order
to make the life of his business
independent of his own term of
years may be the very same form
to which another turns because
a scheme in which he is interested is a venture to which he
does not care to be attached too
definitely or closely.
We have mentioned other

aspects of an organization device
that, from the point of view of
the planner, seem desirable.
Which of these desirable traits,
if any, are of outstanding importance in any particular enterprise
is, of course, a business question
calling for the highest executive
ability. Once this question is determined, however, it is for the
lawyer rather than the executive
to select and adapt that legal
device for organization which
best serves the important ends,
even if some of the minor ends
must be poorly served. Thus,
speed, cheapness, and simplicity in the making, maintaining,
and enforcing of the relations
constituting the organization
may have to be sacrificed to
achieve or maintain plasticity.
Power of control must be generally weighed against freedom
from responsibility for the mistakes or missteps of those who
serve the organization.

secret instructions of the principal, varying the authority of the
agent in a particular transaction
from the ordinary understanding
in such situations, will be ineffective so far as the innocent
stranger is concerned.
5. Problems of Organization
On the whole, the desirability of an organization device
must, therefore, be judged by a
process of weighing the importance of its good and bad features in view of a particular set
of circumstances, and the relative weight to be given to these
features is, in the long run, the
problem of the executive rather
than of the lawyer. A series of
such cases will demonstrate the
nature of the co-operation between the lawyer and the executive in the use of the facilities of
the law for organization.
(1) Let us first consider the
problem of policy in the employment of men in various parts of
an organization.1 Is it desirable,
for example, in the employment
of salesmen to utilize a uniform
standardized contract to be
signed on the dotted line, or is it
preferable to deal with each man
individually and attempt to frame
his contract in accordance with
the individual features of his
case? A discussion of the relative
merits of the standardized and
individual contract as an instrument of organization involves, of
course, the broader question of
the standardization of legal devices for various other business
purposes, such as sales, warehouse receipts, or bills of lading.
But confining ourselves to those
features most clearly affecting
the problem before us, we may
safely venture the opinion that
those who use a standardized
form for their salesmen are
moved to do so by the consideration of the saving of time,
trouble, and expense, when they
compare the task of sitting down

4. Methods of Organization
Disregarding at this stage
the details of law involved in the
use of particular devices for organization, we may classify all
the methods that the lawyer offers to the executive for the solution of his nice problem of adjustment as coming under one
of two heads: (1) contract, and
(2) the creation of special status.
Generally speaking, the effecting
of a division of function coupled
with unification of design by contract furnishes far more room for
play, more plasticity, than does
the adoption of a ready-made
status with all of its incidents laid
down in the law. On the other
hand, status, as illustrated, for
example, by an instance where
an organization is effected
through the acceptance of a corporate charter from the state,
has all the advantages of standardization: thus, hundreds of
details as to the relations between stockholders and directors, between stockholders and

the public, between directors and
the public, between directors and
the company, and so on, are
taken care of without the need
of any specifications of particulars.
When we come to examine,
however, the various types of
contract and status relations, we
shall find that there is a gradation from the most individualized
to the most standardized of arrangements. Contracts, for example, may be subdivided so as
to include contracts without special names, the purport of which
is simply: You do this and I shall
do that. Some of these unnamed
contracts have become more or
less standardized as they have
been found useful in business on
repeated occasions. They lead
gradually into the class of named
contracts: contracts of sale, for
example, leases, employment
contracts, the contracts involved
in a negotiable instrument, mortgages, guaranty, suretyship, insurance, and so on. Some of
these, indeed, are more highly
standardized than others. The
status relations may also be subdivided so as to include, in the
first place, those somewhat akin
to the contract principle in that,
at least as between the parties,
they are subject to extensive
variations. Thus, the relations
between principal and agent or
between the members of a partnership are far more subject to
individual variation than are the
relations of parties in a corporation; but even within the
corporation the particular rights
of holders of special types of
stock may be made to vary in
accordance with the terms of bylaws or particular contracts. What
distinguishes all these status
relations, however, from the
purely contractual relations is
that the outside world is free to
assume that the status relations
are typical rather than individual
and to act accordingly. Where we
have agency, for example, the

53

with each man separately and
talking over his terms with the
infinitely lazier process of copying the contract worked out for
A when B comes in. Of course,
the force of these considerations
is increased when the number of
those affected is large and when
their functions are fairly similar.
The relative advantage of the
process of dealing with all comers alike is enhanced by the tendency it has to break down sales
resistance. The very fact that all
the employees of the house sign
the same agreement removes
doubts and vain wishes for special treatment from the mind of
the applicant. Furthermore, it is
a source of relief to both sides
to feel that the document between them is not experimentalthat it has been worked under and tested, perhaps interpreted authentically, and that it
has taken its present form as a
result of the experience of others. Many a business man would
prefer to make a clear concession
of a point rather than to buy his
way into a law suit.
After the contract of employment is made, it does, of course,
simplify business administration
to be able to give uniform instructions to the clerical force as
to the treatment of all persons
in a class, instead of being compelled to go over with them independently the manner of recording and checking the transactions of each man in the group
separately. It is easier, too, to
make strangers with whom one
deals understand and respect
the stipulations as to the authority vested in ones sales force
or in some other group of employees than it would be if the
impression once got out that
every one of the group had a law
unto himself.
What, then, are the disadvantages of the standardized
salesmans contract? These generally appear, in the first instance
when we consider the matter

from the point of view of the
salesman rather than of the organization, and it is chiefly when
his point of view is respected
because of his individual importance to the concern that a halt
is called to the process. In the
first place, there is something
deadening about the conception
that makes a man a part of a
machine and obscures the individual aspects of his function.
Such aspects may arise from the
differences in advantage and
experience on the part of the
men, from differences in the territory or branch of the trade that
they visit, from differences in.
their personal goodwill or control over customers. To force two
sets of business relationships
into the same legal mold, when,
as a matter of fact, they are different, may superficially solve the
difficulty, but it is likely to create greater difficulties in the end.
It may involve, in the first place,
reducing the legal formula to a
mere form that will not be respected by either party in his
practical interpretation from the
very beginning. On the other
hand, it may result in constant
friction because somebody
somewhere in the organization
insists on taking the legal document too literally. Such a uniform
scheme of things is pretty irksome when it becomes necessary
rapidly to turn a corner in business or to deal with a particular
territory or branch of a business,
in view of an emergency, in some
unforeseen way. For at this point
the original selling argument
that all employees are treated
alike is seen to carry with it, more
or less inarticulately, the corollary that all will continue to be
dealt with alike. In fact, the impersonal standardized system of
dealing with men too frequently
carries with it automatic scales
of increase and rules of promotion that paralyze the hand of the
executive.

(2) A frequent problem of organization encountered in the
course of the expansion of a
business comes down to the
question: Shall we buy the assets
or the stock of the corporation
whose business we are taking
over? 2 We have already discussed some of the considerations involved here, namely, the
comparative desirability of making a unit of the new organization and of keeping the parts of
the resulting organization intact,
separate though related. The
use, and indeed the abuse of the
subsidiary corporation for the
purposes outlined is one of the
most remarkable developments
in the use of legal devices in business of the last generation. A
glance at such manuals as Poors
and Moodys will show the extent
to which operating companies
have become, in part, holding
companies and pure holding
companies have been superimposed on operating companies.
In fact, the controlled company
itself controls others, so that a
pyramid similar to that of feudal
times may be imposed on the
visible, active business, the tenant paravail.3 Among the specific factors in the problem of
buying assets or stock must be
considered the relative cost of
control. Where stock is purchased, only a majority of the
voting power need be acquired.
For the rest, the old financing,
whatever it may have been,
serves its purpose without necessarily involving the new corporation in the work of raising funds,
or the responsibility of underwriting. But with this decreased
cost, it must be remembered,
there goes a decreased degree
of control. The controlling company is by no means free to transfer to itself such parts of the business of the controlled company
as it can take over most profitably. The minority stockholders
can insist on the maintenance of
the status quo between the two

(3) A very common business
problem that assumes constantly
changing form is whether to incorporate. A great deal of literature has been scattered by officials and more or less interested
private institutions setting forth
in glowing terms the advantages

of incorporation. In general,
these are two: (a) the limitation
of liability upon the part of the
investor, and (b) the standardization of the resulting relations.
Each of these may be subdivided
and elaborated in various ways.
Thus, (a) the limitation of liability is not merely the personal assurance that one will not be liable for the debts of the corporation at all or beyond a certain
point in case of insolvency; it includes the freedom from the risk
of being bound by the activities
or representations of associates
not duly authorized to represent
the organization. It includes, further, the assurance that even the
duly authorized officers cannot
go beyond very definite limits set
out in the articles of incorporation and the charter or the general laws under which the company is organized. (b) Standardization, in this case, includes
a fairly definite understanding as
to the rights and liabilities of
stockholders, some of which no
doubt cannot be modified effectively even by special contract.
But it must not be assumed
that these advantages are in any
sense absolute. There are, first
of all, legal limitations to the
types of business that a corporation may be engaged in. For
example, in most states, a corporation is not permitted to engage in such a profession as the
practice of law or the practice of
medicine. Furthermore, there are
definite laws preventing corporations organized for one set of
purposes from engaging in certain other activities. Department
stores have, for example, found
to their chagrin that they are not
only effectively barred in some
states from opening dental departments, but also that they
must not engage in insurance or
banking or various public utility
enterprises. The growth of licensing laws has extended the field
closed to the corporation, because licenses are in general

www.suspicions.com

purely personal. Sometimes attempts are made to use the idea
of licensing deliberately to check
the use of the corporate form.4
(b) With regard to standardization, we have already indicated in another connection
that there are situations in which
it is important to have a handmade, specially ordered device
rather than the standardized
forms that meet approximately
the conditions of all business,
but only approximately. In other
words, the corporation is not so
plastic as the partnership or the
business trust or the business
conducted under individual ownership. In like manner, the desirability of limited liability is questionable at times. It may simply
mean that the men responsible
for a corporate undertaking are
called upon for personal indorsement of the corporations debts.
There are also businesses bordering on professions, such as
that of the investment banker, in
which a distinct loss of prestige
might result from incorporation.
There are, too, numerous undertakings in which the heavy
mechanism of a corporation is,
to say the least, cumbersome. It
may involve for a very small business an expense, a degree of
publicity, an opening to attack
by one who casually or deliberately comes into possession of a
share of stock, a complicated and
perhaps costly tax situation, a
keeping of minutes, and the rigmarole of elections, which at best
are a nuisance and at worst a
stumbling block, for there is always danger that the omission
of routine will invalidate important acts.
(4) The problem whether to
organize the retailing branch of
ones business as an agency in
the technical legal sense of the
term, or by constituting the distributors independents or such
semi-independents as del cred-

corporations, and however limited we may find the ultimate
powers of the minority, among
these powers we shall find a destruction of the plasticity of an
organization.
There is a curious condition
in the Federal statute law pertaining to combinations in restraint
of trade that has no doubt driven
many businesses to avoid the
purchase of stock and prefer the
method of purchasing assets in
effecting any combination with
a competitive concern. In Section
7 of the Clayton Act (1914) one
of the objectionable methods
enumerated and made unlawful,
even if only tending to substantially lessen competition or to
create a monopoly in any line of
commerce, is the acquisition,
directly or indirectly, of the whole
or any part of the stock or share
capital of another corporation. In
the absence of this or any of the
other specially enumerated objectionable methods of creating
a monopoly, one would have to
allege a great deal more to bring
the case under the Sherman AntiTrust Act. One would have to
show that there had been effected a monopoly, or that there
had been what the law calls an
attempt to monopolize, or a conspiracy to monopolize, a part of
interstate commerce. The attempt or conspiracy or success
in monopolization is so different
in the eyes of the law from the
mere tendency described in the
Clayton Act, that there are no
doubt instances in which it is
safe to buy the assets of a competing concern, though it may
not be so to purchase any part
of its stock.

ere agents, or by the use of subsidiary corporations is, of course,
primarily a problem of planning
in which the legal possibilities
must be studied rather carefully.
Of course, for many undertakings the problem is solved by the
nature of the commodity, almost
regardless of the legal disadvantages involved. It would be impractical, for example, to sell
goods that are looked for in a
grocery store or a dry goods
store, and that altogether make
up a small part of the stock of
such stores, through local
branches employing agents in
every part of the country. Furthermore, a business must be
quite large in order to make the
establishment of local branches
pay, and it must be financially
very strong to make such a venture at all possible. Few publishers, indeed, could do what the
Curtis Publishing Company did
when it converted over 450
wholesale dealers into local
agents.5
On the other hand, it may be
the very weakness of a manufacturer that forces him to deal
through local agents rather than
through independents. This is
illustrated in the automobile industry where a factory branch in
an Eastern community is likely to
be the result of a defeat in the
effort of the manufacturer to find
a local distributor willing and
able to bear the financial burden
of handling his car as an independent dealer. A shoe manufacturer who is not primarily engaged in the retailing of shoes
may find himself confronted with
the necessity of maintaining a
chain of retail stores as an outlet for his product, or even if the
major part of his product is sold
through independents he may
find that, in order to gain an entrance into a particular territory,
he must finance in whole or in
part the venture of opening a
store there.
But between these two lim-

its of compulsion and free choice
there are many cases in which
the problem of how to organize
ones distribution is one of the
most difficult that confronts the
executive. A rubber manufacturer, when asked why his house
dealt so largely with retailers instead of jobbers, replied that in
the early days of his venture his
competitors were so much stronger than he was that they could
easily have demolished him in a
market consisting of a half a
dozen or a dozen jobbers, but
that with several thousand small
accounts on his books he felt far
safer; or, as he graphically put
it, They had plenty of ammunition for bears, but nothing to
hunt chipmunks with. Manufacturers sometimes look with
covetous eyes at the profits
made by the jobbers and adopt
a policy of selling directly to the
retailers. In many cases they
learn a good deal in the process
of the experiment and sometimes they find that the cost of
distributing directly is greater
than it would be through the jobber. Frequently they find that the
skill with which they are able to
manufacture effectively is of a
very different kind from that
which is required for effective
distribution.6
With these phases of the
problem the law is, of course, not
directly concerned. Once the decision is reached by the executive as to the degree of independence to be accorded to the local distributor, the lawyer can
easily find a way of crystallizing
the organization so as to meet
the plan. But the plan itself is
likely to change in the course of
consultation with the lawyer, by
reason of the information he is
able to give as to the limited control that accompanies the limited
responsibility of dealing with independent distributors. The dictation of policies, of what shall
be sold or shall not be sold in
company with particular goods,

is cut off. On the other hand, if
increased control is desired, the
lawyers information as to the
increased responsibility involved
may cause the executive to go
back from the conference with a
very nice problem in the choice
of evils. One cannot shake off his
responsibility for the acts of his
agent, nor can he even limit the
authority of the agent effectively,
so far as outsiders are concerned, by anything that the lawyer can draw up in his office.
(5) We come next to the
problem of superorganization.
The legal limitations that make
it difficult and occasionally illegal to co-operate with ones competitors, though involved in every problem of co-operation, can
best be treated in another chapterthat dealing with the maintenance of competition as a market prerequisite. There are, however, certain undisputed fields in
which unrelated businesses and
even competing businesses may
co-operate. In the first place, the
anti-trust laws make certain specific exemptions, such as labor
organizations and farmers cooperative organizations. Again,
although the boundaries have
not yet been clearly marked out
by the courts, it is definitely conceded today that there is an important field within which trade
associations may facilitate cooperation. 7 Thus, they may
gather and exchange information; they may elaborate standards and codes of ethics; they
may develop arbitration tribunals: always provided that in
such activities they do not go to
the point of directly or indirectly
eliminating competition.
There can be no doubt that
the tendency to co-operate in
various ways is increasing. In
fact, in every really difficult problem one suggestion that comes
up is co-operation with others
faced with the same problem.
Thus, in a community in which

vice bureau related to the various members of subscribers by
simple individual contracts. It
may, within its specific field, have
no powers beyond suggestion or
advice or the simple reporting of
information; or it may be vested
with the powers of an agent to
bind its constituents either with
each other or to the outside
world contractually. It may be
readily subject to dissolution at
the desire of any party, or it may
be that the very nature of its objects requires a definite duration
for its activities.
For all of these various needs
the law can supply more or less
appropriate forms. In fact, a very
interesting chapter in modern
business history is concerned
with the readiness with which the
lawyer has supplied new forms
of association as old ones were
found to be or made illegal. Thus,
when big business began in
this country some time after the
Civil War, it experimented for a
short time with rather simple
contracts in restraint of trade. On
discovering that contracts not to
compete were ineffective and
that slight changes in their setup failed to save them, experimentation soon turned to various types of pools. The buying
pool or the selling pool was perhaps something more than a
simple contract in restraint of
trade. It was more like the joint
adventure that competitors under ordinary conditions could
concededly engage in, where a
particular undertaking was too
big for the capital of any one of
them. But in course of time it
became clear that the pool, too,
could be looked upon as a contract in restraint of trade, and so,
being unenforceable, fell to
pieces of its own weight.
The next great experiment in
this direction, that of the 80s,
was by avoiding contract altogether and seeking a combination through the ancient device
of trusteeship. Strictly speaking,

www.suspicions.com

trusteeship, which gave unified
ownership in the eyes of the law
to a small group, did not involve
any contract as the basis for the
elimination of competition in
business controlled by the trustees. It was not until the end of
the 80s that the courts began
to reach the conclusion that a
trusteeship in restraint of trade
was subject to the same laws as
a contract in restraint of trade,
and the Sherman Anti-Trust Act
and the state acts drawn on the
same model removed all doubt
by declaring not only contracts
but combinations in restraint of
trade, and, in fact, monopolies
however created, illegal and void.
But the ingenuity of the organizers did not stop there.
There was no authoritative pronouncement as yet to make it
impossible to grow to the size
of a monopoly by the out-and-out
purchase of the stock of competing corporations. And so the
holding company came into existence. Another decade passed
before that, too, was ascertained
to be illegal under the sweeping
terms of the Sherman Act.
Meanwhile, experimentation
had grown up along such lines
as the interlocking directorate.
But as all of these were upon
examination found to involve the
same obnoxious element of combination in restraint of trade,
nothing seemed to remain but
the out-and-out merger by the
complete unification of associates and the obliteration of the
old framework of the corporations absorbed in the course of
the growth of a business.
Eventually that, too, was
found illegal or at least capable
of being illegal unless so managed as carefully to avoid the
obnoxious features that had
come to be understood as the
definition of monopoly. Since
1915 the emphasis has been
rather on the isolation and detection of these features than on
mere size. In one sense it may

several manufacturers are engaged in the same general kind
of work, all may be interested in
eliminating the floating of laborers from factory to factory by
coming together and adopting a
uniform policy and agreeing to
exchange labor information. In
fact, the problem frequently
reaches such proportions that no
action on the part of a single
manufacturer can cope with the
situation at all. In like manner,
wholesale or even retail dealers
may desire to exchange credit
information. No one of them may
care to risk the odium or even to
incur the expense involved in an
aggressive policy of fighting the
fraudulent debtor. For such purposes, they may wish to unite.
They may likewise have common
problems of research, problems
ranging from those of pure science, such as chemistry, down
through applied science to such
trivialities as research in the
probable effect of style changes
on the demand for particular dyestuffs. A single manufacturer
may find himself quite helpless,
in the face of competition, in any
attempt to standardize styles or
even gauges of parts of machines. Cooperation may be necessary to save whole industries
from chaos in this respect.
In all such cases, quite apart
from the question of what the law
will allow, there is the executive
question of what is desirable in
kind and in degree of association
to bring about the desired end.
Much can be accomplished by
simple goodwill in a centralized
industry. Credit information, for
example, may be exchanged by
jobbers without any preconceived plan. On the other
hand, in some situations a centralized office may be necessary,
and this office may be conducted
under the guise of an organization in which the co-operators
hold shares. It may be an unincorporated association, or it may
be an entirely independent ser-

be said that the ingenuity of the
lawyers in supplying new frameworks of association as rapidly
as the old ones were smashed by
the axe of the law has been unsuccessful. But the object of
passing these types of organization in rapid review at this point
is not by any means to test the
adequacy of the wording or the
wisdom of the anti-trust legislation: it is simply to illustrate the
types of organization at the
lawyers command as they have
appeared in the last generation
in efforts towards superorganization.

(6) In the planning of relations, business men are constantly confronted with the apportionment of risks. Writers on
economics have frequently isolated the function of bearing
risks analytically and assumed
that in some imaginary or ideal
society this function could be
borne by one type of participant
in the economic processes, a
participant whom they have generally called the entrepreneur.
In the actual world of business,
however, the function of the entrepreneur is blown to pieces and
scattered so widely and intricately that the process of finding the entrepreneur, sure as we
may be that he must exist, is almost hopeless. The difficulty is
exactly parallel to the task that
political writers often impose
upon themselves to isolate and
discover sovereignty in a modern state. That somebody, somewhere, somehow exercises the
functions in the modem state
that made Louis XIV a sovereign
in his state is quite true. But by
means of constitutions, written
and unwritten, those functions
have been given to groups of
people acting in various capacities and in various ways, so that
the putting together of the atomized sovereign is as hopeless as
the restoration of Humpty
Dumpty. In like manner, risk

bearing in any enterprise is today divided among its promoters, those who furnish its initial
capital, those who furnish its
current funds, its employees, its
creditors, and in fact everyone
who deals with it directly or indirectly.
The process of deliberately
and consciously shifting risk is
effected by contracts of insurance. But by far the greater part
of risk adjustment is effected in
business through stipulations
rarely if ever thought of as insurance. Thus, a stipulation postponing or accelerating the passing of title in a sale carries with
it a postponement or acceleration, as the case may be, of many
of the risks ordinarily covered by
insurance. In like manner, the
difference between calling a man
an authorized agent and constituting him an authorized
dealer is essentially a difference
in the apportionment of risks.
There is a difference in the risk
assumed when one deals with a
corporation from that which
would be involved if the opposite party were charged with unlimited personal responsibility.
Warranties are essentially assumptions of risks about things
beyond the actual knowledge of
the person assuming responsibility. Every contract of employment involves either the risk of
keeping an employee and paying
him when he is not needed if the
term is definite, or a corresponding risk on the part of the employee of the loss of a job where
the term is indefinite. The significance of the last proposition as
to labor is quite frequently overlooked. Though it is often said
that the laborer risks nothing in
a venture and that the investor
is the sole entrepreneur, in truth,
the laborer who brings his family to a community, who settles
within it and becomes part of it,
and who enters into an enterprise subject to the daily risk of
losing his position, is perhaps

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

the most venturesome of all
entrepreneurs, though in his
case the risk may seem to be
adjusted rather through the silence of the contract than
through what it says.
The risk of non-sale of securities may be met by the formation of an underwriting syndicate whose members agree to
take portions of the securities
issued if they cannot be sold
through the channels prescribed
in the first instance within an
agreed period of time. The manufacturers of patterns are confronted with the question who
shall bear the risk, not only of
non-sale but of rapid obsolescence. Others who are subject to
rapid economic effects of
changes in fashions must work
out a plan either of leaving the
burden of change where it falls
or of insuring their distributors
or distributing agents against it.
The significance, in this connection, of hand-to-mouth buying is
worthy of study. In some industries it has involved a complete
deflection from the distributor to
the producer of the rapid
changes in value. All laws,
whether statutory or customary,
and all specific stipulations of
contracts bearing on the question What constitutes an excuse
for non-performance of a contract? are risk directing devices.
Contracts, for example, which
are made subject to strikes, lockouts, fires, or other unavoidable
causes of loss or delay, which
would otherwise be risks of the
person assuming the obligation
to perform, are essentially of the
nature of insurance contracts. In
a broader sense, the bankruptcy
law is virtually a device for shifting the risks of the independent
dealer to the business which furnishes his supplies or his credit.
An ever-increasing number
of these risks is being made the
subject of conscious barter in the
form of insurance contracts. A
mere enumeration of these will

suffice to indicate the importance of recent developments,
and in reading the list it must be
remembered that the possibilities have by no means as yet

dealings on the part of the directors than to his vote.
As the matter stands today,
there are legal facilities available
for almost any imaginable combination of ownership or control
to accompany investment, ranging from the highly protected but
otherwise weak position of the
bondholder to the strong position of self-help of the stockholder in whose hands voting
power may not only exist but
may be concentrated or rendered
doubly effective through combination in voting trusts.
(8) Miscellaneous executive
problems in the choice of legal
forms of organization have to do
with the use of the Massachusetts trust, though this is constantly being made to work more
and more like a corporation even
in those jurisdictions that do not
class it as an out-and-out partnership; with the various special
types of partnership that our
state legislatures are offering for
one type or another of business;
with the alternative of what
amounts to Federal incorporation open to banks; with the
choice of a state in which to incorporate; with the particular
scheme of capitalization and the
relation of ownership to voting
power; with the raising of capital by the sale of stocks or of
bonds. For a solution of all these
and similar questions, the lawyer is able to furnish the executive essential information as to
the nature and workings of each
of his devices. It is for the executive, however, to make the
choice.

(7) Problems of finance in
the sense of the planning of the
financial structure of a business
likewise are embraced within organization as we use the term.
Of course, the law is called upon
to safeguard the interest of the
man who puts forward money to
be administered by another.
These safeguards as such we can
discuss to better purpose along
with the facilities for credit in
general. What we are concerned
with here is the degree of control or the ownership that goes
along with investment under one
scheme or an-other of organization. In the simplest forms of
organization, ownership and
control are, of course, identical.
A distinction must be drawn,
however, between partnerships,
which are really jointly owned
business ventures, and business
trusts. In the latter there is, of
course, great danger that a degree of control will be given to
the beneficial owners which will
convert them into partners in the
eyes of the law. The difference is
clear enough in extreme cases.
The partners take an active hand
in the management of their business; the beneficiaries in the
trust have no control over the
actual management of the business. There is, however, a very
difficult borderland in which ever
so slight a power of control ac-

tual or threatened is reposed in
the beneficiaries, and in these
cases courts differ as to whether
they shall be dealt with as partnerships.
In the corporate form, a wide
latitude exists in respect to the
type and degree of control to be
exercised by the investors. A distinction must be borne in mind,
however, between the legal
theory of control of stockholders
funds and the actual practice in
large corporations. A good deal
of recent discussion of the disfranchisement in recent years of
the investor, by means of the
multiplication of the varieties of
non-voting stock, is based upon
an oversight of this divergence
between the legal theory and the
business practice of control by
stockholders. If there has been
a disfranchisement of the small
stockholder, it has by no means
been accomplished by recent
manipulations in which non-voting stock has more or less surreptitiously been substituted for
voting stock. The disfranchisement complained of has been a
growth of long duration, not very
different in its workings from the
disfranchisement of the voter in
politics who has been a victim of
party manipulation and perhaps
of his own despair of exerting
any influence through his lone
vote. The individual stockholder
has generally felt his lack of experience, lack of understanding
of the issues involved in his vote
for this or that director, and so
has relied upon the conduct of
his affairs by men who had more
at stake and who were in a better position to make an investigation. It is, of course, true that
the voting privilege not exercised
carries with it a reserve force and
perhaps even a constant threat
that was of some importance in
the business world until recently.
But gradually the individual
stockholder came to look more
and more to the law to protect
him by its requirements of fair

Historic Legal Materials

(1) AGENCY. The law is apt
to labor hard to discover whether

a particular situation is one to be
labeled agency or independent
dealing. Then, after determining
by the merest hairs breadth that
the relation is agency, it launches
forth dogmatically with the consequences, which will include
absolute loyalty and fidelity and
the exclusion of activities detrimental to the principals interest.
If, on the other hand, it determines that, on the whole, the label of independent dealer is the
more fitting, it proceeds equally
unsparingly to lay down the opposite rules: the alleged principal, who is now found to be
merely a supplier, cannot even
by contract hope to prevent his
purchaser from dealing in the
products of his competitor. Likewise, however nice may be the
question whether one, who has
put money into a friends business and rendered other assistance from time to time, has
made himself a partner, once the
law reaches the conclusion that
he is, it is inexorable in piling on
him exactly the opposite consequences from those that would
have followed from the finding
that the same facts had made
him a creditor instead. The group
of partners who decide to incorwww.suspicions.com

porate because one feature of
the incorporation lawsay, limited liabilitypleases them, learn
very soon that they have simultaneously given their business
other features not so pleasing
for example, the destruction of
the delectus personae (choice of
person) that they had previously
enjoyed. When we ask why these
combinations come in such curious bundles, we are soon turned
to history for an answer.
Before we go into the history
of the forms of organization now
in use we may pay tribute to
other schemes for the organization of business life that have
passed away, and look at still
others that are put forward as
possible substitutes for those
that we are familiar with. The socalled feudal system of the
Middle Ages in Europe was really
no single system, but a vast variety of arrangements that had
one tendency in common,
namely, to confuse what we separate as political and economic
aspects of life. Dominium was
both kinds of authority. On the
economic side this confusion, or
rather fusion, brought about the
appearance of ones being born
to legally enforceable rights and

1. Devices
Used in Organization
If we turn to the law to find
ready-made answers to our demand for a finely adjusted readymade plan, giving for any purpose in hand just the required
balance of control and responsibility, of intimacy and isolation,
of risks and security, of planning
and adventure, of foreseeability
and freedom, we shall probably
be disappointed. The foundations of our legal institutions
were laid down long ago with no
thought of pleasing the modern
business man. He must pick and
choose among them and modify
and combine what he finds until
he develops a workable mechanism for putting legal force behind his business plan. If we list
the mechanisms that he uses as,
roughly, (1) contracts, including
the named and standardized varieties, (2) agency, (3) partnership, (4) corporations and (5)
trusteeship, we may profitably
contrast their several histories;
for in these histories we must
find the explanation of many of
their most serious divergencies.

duties in a planned economy. To
assume such a position in society if one was not born into it
required a ceremony rather than
a contracthomagium, it was
called. Eventually functions that
the feudal system did not provide for were found necessary in
society. Hence, merchants were
only loosely associated with it.
Yet the right to hold a fair was a
feudal type of right, and the Jews
and other foreigners who were
permitted to engage in business
did so either as vassals of the
king or as holders of what might
be described as quasi-feudal
charters. With the growth of cities and urban industries, another
system of business organization
was developed: the domestic system. The master was master of a
household as well as of his craft,
and to this household the apprentice became attached. The
journeyman came into the
masters household for the working day. Until recently the law
books echoed this way of looking at business organization, by
classifying the relation of master and servant as a domestic
relation, though the movement
for the substitution of the shop
and factory for the home as the
place of industry and commerce
robbed this classification of its
meaning over a hundred years
ago.
(2) CONTRACT. We have already discussed in another connection the nineteenth century
reliance on the contract idea. The
field of organization was no exception. The relation of employer
and employee in particular was
regarded as contractual and subject, as such, to the quasi-constitutional principle of freedom
of contract. In the first years of
the twentieth century the relationship has been removed farther and farther from the realm
of simple contract through social
legislation that dictates duties
and liabilities for the employer,

any contract to the contrary notwithstanding. Such laws include
employers
liability
and
workmens compensation laws,
the safety of working places,
sanitary conditions, holidays, the
right to organize for collective
bargaining and other purposes
and, in an increasing number of
exceptional situations, minimum wages and maximum
hours.
Closely related to the employment of labor and yet differing in one all-important particular, is the employment or authorization of agents. The ordinary
employee is not expected to
bring his employer into legal relations with a strangerthough
he has the power to do so
through a tort, a wrongful act
inflicting damage. The agent, on
the other hand, is employed for
the purpose of establishing contractual relations between his
principal and outsiders. The
nineteenth century books were
inclined to bring the relations
between principal and agent under the heading of contract.
Strictly speaking, no contract is
necessary to create this relation,
and whether it can be terminated
by the will of either party in violation of a contract depends on
legal principles other than contractual intent. Persons not legally capable of making contracts may, in many instances,
appoint or be-come agents.
There is no necessity of such legal prerequisites of contract as
consideration to make an
agency valid. Of course, it is also
true that in actual business affairs an agent is usually employed under a contract. The incidents of agency, however, so
often fly in the very face of the
actual agreement between a principal and his agent that we must
seek an explanation for them in
some other branch of the law.
The scope of an agents power
is not measured by his actual
authorization but by the appar-

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

ent scope of his authority. Historians have traced the doctrines
of agency to slavery, to the Roman patriarchal households and
to various odd institutions in
ancient Roman and Germanic
law. The truth is that its fundamental maxim, Qui facit per
alium facit per se, a maxim
which sets forth the fiction of
identity between principal and
agent, has been taken from the
Canon Law of the Roman Catholic Church. That law may have
taken it from the Orient where it
was an established principle, and
it is possible that it was influenced in doing so by the theological concepts of vicarious sin
and vicarious atonement which
are logically related to it.
(3) PARTNERSHIP. The most
popular form of business organization in the nineteenth century lent itself well to the contract idea: partnership. The men
who wish to cooperate in a venture build their relation on a contractthe articles of partnershipwhether written or oral.
Yet here, as in agency, they soon
find that there are many matters
beyond the control of their contract, notably their relations to
the outside world, but also in
their internal relations. From the
historians point of view they
were employing a form of organization that had its principal
development not in English law
but on the continent of Europe,
and there it went back not to
ancient business precedents but
to the situation of co-parceners,
members of a family (usually
daughters) who found themselves in possession of the family property with no organization
among them. The principal
proposition that the law laid
down was that any one of them
could work with any part of the
property, provided only that a
complete accounting of such voluntary stewardship would be
forthcoming to the others even-

tually. The law of partnership has
undergone much development in
the course of two thousand
years, but this broad power to act
coupled with a duty to account
afterwards is still of its essence,
and the owning of an enterprise
in common is still a workable
definition for it.

slightly different forms for widely
divergent objects, such as the
evasion of feudal burdens, as a
substitute for or a supplement
to last wills and testaments, as a
basis for organizing charities
and dissenting churches, as an
entering wedge for freeing the
estates of married women from
their husbands control, and in
more recent times for many business purposes illustrated in the
daily work of the modern trust
company. Though plastic in the
extreme, it is hardly to be expected that this instrumentality
taken from the Middle Ages will
serve all new needs as they arise
without embarrassment or modification. In fact it seems that it is
the curious fate of this device to
serve as a pathfinder, to be superseded eventually by roadmakers who pay the pathfinder
the curious complement of naming the roads in his honor. This
historic formula is reflected in
each of the following familiar
terms: charitable trusts, monopolistic trusts (or simply
trusts), investment trusts, voting trusts, trust receipts. In each
case the purpose once accomplished by trusteeship is now
accomplished more generally by
a more specialized tool, though
the old phrase is retained. In the
case of Massachusetts trusts, or
business trusts, trusteeship still
remains discernible, though for
purposes of taxation and control
they have been made increasingly like corporations through
a series of statutory enactments.
2. Modification of
Organization Devices
All of these types of organization devices are subject to constant modification by specific
agreement. Even the position of
the stockholder may be said to
be increasingly contractual as a
result of preferences, voting restrictions, redemption clauses,
and various rules in the by-laws
regarding special majorities

Suspicions News Magazine

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

(4) CORPORATION. When we
change a partnership into a corporation we are substituting a
model of a government for that
of a family group. The origins of
both the modern corporation and
of constitutions go back to the
same kind of royal charter. There
is not much difference between
the charters on the basis of
which the American colonies
were established and those given
to such trading bodies as the
Muscovy Company or the East
India Company. Both types have
governmental and business features. They develop differently by
suppressing one or the other
groups of features. Yet the business corporation still retains its
governmental machinery of voting, officers, oaths, formality of
meetings, records, by-laws, official notices, and public reports.
This is rather heavy machinery
for a little retail store or a modest factory. Its weight sometimes
produces curious results, not the
least of which are connected with
the habit of neglecting the holding of formal meetings, the keeping of minutes, and the giving of
notices. The granting of the privilege of incorporation is still regarded as a high act of sovereignty, and although the process
of taking advantage of this act
of sovereignty has been reduced
first to the stage of accepting a
contractual offer and then to a
mere filling out of forms and paying of a fee, the necessity of carefully complying with all formal requirements, and the rigorously
standardized legal results that
follow, are reminiscent of the
origin of the corporation.

(5) TRUSTEESHIP. Another
way of bringing business capital
together into an association with
a unified front having many of
the advantages of incorporation
is by means of trusteeship. Reduced to its simplest terms, the
arrangement is a copy of what
happens when a man leaves his
business at his death to a trustee
to manage for the benefit of his
family. The members of the family in such a case have nothing
to do with the actual management and no responsibility for
the acts of the trustee. Their risk
is limited to the capital invested
in the business. The trustee, on
the other hand, is liable personally on all contracts. Yet he may
avoid such liability by specification in each contract, and
thereby produce a result quite
similar to the limited liability of
corporation law. This whole setup may be copied by the creation
of a trust among living persons.
An early impetus to experiment
with such a plan came in Massachusetts, where the general corporation law failed to provide for
corporations created for certain
purposes, particularly for dealing
in real estate. When this so-called
Massachusetts trust came into
being, we had a most striking
example of a legal device created
for one purpose and ultimately
used for purposes undreamed of
while the device was taking
shape.
The idea underlying trusteeship may be roughly expressed
as separating the legal tide from
the equitable interest, allowing
the legal title to reside in one
person or group who hold for the
benefit of another person or
group. This idea seems to have
found its way into England in the
thirteenth century as a device
whereby the Franciscan and Dominican friars were able to work
property given to them, in spite
of the restrictions of their orders
and of the law. It was used in
successive generations in

63

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

needed for special purposes,
particular rights, or limitations of
minorities. In a partnership, as
between the parties great deviation from the norm or type laid
down in the Uniform Partnership
Act is possible, subject always to
the difficulty, in the absence of
statutory authority, of effectively
bringing such deviation to the
attention of strangers so that
they may respect it. In trusteeship, by elaboration of the articles of trust and of the trust
certificate, similar deviation is
possible, provided that the certificate holders are not given
such control over the actions of
the trustees as to make them
partners in the eyes of the law.

64

3. Inter-unital Organizations
The devices that are available
for the organization of the business unit are also used for interunital organization: contract,
agency, partnership, incorporation and trusteeship. When so
used they not only require more
drastic adaptation and more skilful combination of devices, but
greater precautions against
passing the limits set by the law.
Not only must we have regard for
the anti-trust laws, but also for
the tradition of the law that declares a corporation incapable of
becoming a member of a partnership or otherwise delegating the
powers vested by the law in its
directors; also the rules of law
against restraints on alienation
of property, against perpetuities,
against the combination of certain businesses in units, against
particular uses of certain devices
(such as clogging the equity of
redemption in a mortgage). We
must also be circumspect about
the incidence of taxation in its
relation to inter-unital arrangements. The consolidation of returns may be allowed or disal-

lowed with rather curious results
when we attempt to balance certain gains against certain losses.
Recent discriminatory taxes
against chain stores have led, on
the one hand, to separate incorporation with tying contracts,
and, on the other, to the substitution of super-markets for small
links in chains. The supermarket
may itself be a composite organization with department leases
of the nature of concessions at
fairs. With infinitely expanding
business needs and a few finite
legal devices, the practical law of
business organization may well
be described as kaleidoscopic.
4. Business Mans versus
Lawyers Organization
As a consequence of the
multifarious new uses to which
these limited historical materials
are put, there is frequently a
great divergence between what
might be called the business
mans organization chart and the
lawyers in any given situation.
The lawyer, for example, may set
down the directors at the head
of his corporation chart. In a particular corporation, however, the
directors may be dummies. The
president, or treasurer, or chairman of the board, or the manager may be the real head of a
businessor the one bearing
such a title may be a mere rubber-stamp. The lawyer dogmatically sets down the stockholders
as investors and the bondholders as outsiders who lend money
to a business. It may be much
truer to business reality to set
the bondholders down in particular cases as investors. With
highly modified preferred stock,
there may even be a reason for
looking upon some stockholders
as essentially outside lenders.
Likewise, legal mortgagors may
in particular business set-ups be

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

branch managers, as in the tiedhouse arrangement familiar in
the retailing of liquor. Legal lessees may be department managers in a department store. In
bank representatives sent to
watch over a business, the law
may refuse to see anything but
ordinary directors elected by
stockholders. The climax is
reached in an equity receivership
in which nothing is called by the
same name in legal and business
parlance. The whole procedure in
business is frankly a reorganization proceeding. The law prior to
the recent amendment of the
Bankruptcy Act knew nothing of
any such proceedingwe simply
had a bill in equity under one of
its recognized grounds of jurisdiction in the course of which a
receivership was incidentally
asked for and allowed pending
the outcome. To the business
man the receivership was merely
an umbrella under which he
could proceed to negotiate for a
better organization. The court,
solemnly pretending to be unconscious of these negotiations
or the purpose of the postponements asked for, is eventually
induced to incorporate its results
in the form of a series of wholly
imaginary hearings, findings,
appraisals, sales, orders, decrees
and accountings.
To follow any legal proposition about business organization
into lifes realities may require
two kinds of learning the
somewhat limited legal learning
about the legal devices that are
used, and the far more complicated and changing business
lore about the realities of the
situation. To a brief restatement
of the first of these, we shall devote the next chapter. To a few
aspects of the latter type of study
we shall devote our final chapter.

Chapter X

Substantive Law

1. Formation of the Relations
(1) AGENCY. Agency is
formed by authorization on the
part of the principal and acceptance of the charge by the agent.
There may or may not be a contract involved in the act of authorization. In business there
usually is, because there is a
stipulation of payment to the
agent for his services in consideration for a definite promise on
his part to do the work that is
expected of him. It is possible,

however, for persons who have
no capacity to contract, or only a
limited capacity, to appoint or
become agents. The greatest
difficulty of law arises in situations that might be called quasiagency, for they are rather cases
in which the law deals with the
parties as if agency existed than
true cases of agency. Such situations arise where one has so
acted that it would be unfair to
permit him to deny that another
has been acting as his agent; or
where no agency in fact existed
at the time of attempted action
by the so-called agent, but where
his acts were afterwards accepted and ratified by the principal. Finally, there are situations
of so-called agency by operation
of law, as where the wife is held
to be the agent of the husband
for the purchase of family necessaries. In all of these cases the
law has found it convenient to
assimilate the situation to that
of true agency based on the
simple act of authorization in
advance, which is the ordinary
basis for permitting one to act
for and in the name of another.1
(2) PARTNERSHIP. Partnership is really double or multiple
agency. In the simplest partnership, each member of a group

www.suspicions.com

authorizes all of the others to
represent him so far as the business is concerned. Here, too, the
phenomenon of quasi-partnership must be provided for where
there is no authorization but only
the misleading appearance of it.
The exchange of authorizations
and the other incidents to a partnership amount to a contract
which may be expressed in written articles of partnership covering the plans and purposes of
the undertaking, the duties of
each of the member; and their
share in the ownership and control of the business and in profits and losses. In neither agency
nor partnership is any special
authorization from the state required or any particular formality ordinarily insisted on by the
law.
There are, however, certain
special forms of partnership
which are made possible solely
by statute and which give to
some or all of the members advantages which they could not
arrogate to themselves without
the aid of a special law.2 Such
are the limited partnerships in
which one or more members
have only limited liability for the
debts of the business, and certain other special statutory partnerships in which the powers of

Passing by the law of contracts, which bulks as large in the
work of organization as in other
branches of business law, we
have as the specific topics in substantive law for restatement in
connection with organization:
Agency, Partnership, Business
Trust, and Corporation.
We shall deal with the rules
for the formation of each of these
relations; then with their operation as to outsiders, their operation within the organization, and,
finally, their dissolution. Under
each of these headings we shall
deal first with Agency, then with
Partnership and particular varieties of partnerships, with Business Trusts and similar associations, and finally with Corporations.

65

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

66

members to bind each other are
modified after the general manner of corporations. No one can
claim the advantage of one of
these statutory partnerships unless he has complied in every
detail with the requirements of
the statute that calls them into
existence. In some cases this rule
has been so rigidly enforced that
persons have found themselves
saddled with all of the burdens
of an ordinary partnership
merely because of having overlooked some very technical point
in connection with the public
notice required by law.
Between the partnership and
the corporation stands the joint
stock company. Unlike the ordinary partnership, its ownership
is divided into large numbers of
transferable shares which permit
the ready entrance and exit of
members without the consent of
those already in the business.
Furthermore, there is more designed specialization of functions, with officers chosen and
endowed with the exclusive
power to bind the business venture in contracts. There is, however, in the absence of special
legislative authority, no provision
for limited liability in these organizations; in fact, as in the
case of the ordinary partnership,
there is no need of relying on any
special statute, such an association being purely voluntary.
(3) BUSINESS TRUST. For the
formation of the business trust3,
the essentials are the same as in
any other trust- the separation
of the legal title from what might
be called the equitable title to
property. This might be accomplished either by conveying the
legal title to A and the equitable
title to B, and by imposing
charges on A in connection with
the administration of the estate
for the benefit of B. Or it might
be accomplished by having the
holder of both titles convey either the legal title or the equi-

table interest in the property to
another. Normally, in the case of
the business trust, the owners of
the property or funds hand over
the legal title to a group of trustees and take from them a trust
receipt which recites that the
funds or properties are to be
administered for the benefit of
the numerous owners. At first
sight it might appear that no
statutory aid is necessary to accomplish this end. In many
states, however, courts have refused to recognize this type of
institution as anything but a
partnership, and recently even in
those states where the so-called
Massachusetts trust has been
recognized there has been a tendency to treat them very much
like corporations, both in the
matter of taxation4 and in the
issue of securities.5 Registration
of deeds of trust has sometimes
been required, and in general
there is a tendency to treat such
voluntary associations more and
more as if they were corporations.
(4) CORPORATION. For the
formation of the corporation, to
a greater extent than in any of
the cases recited so far, the consent of the state is necessary.
Theoretically, the state gives a
group of people a charter which
enables them to act as a body,
and the state recognizes this
body as a person separate and
distinct from the natural persons
who have organized or at any
particular time control the corporation. It can sue and be sued
in its own name, it can hold the
title to personal property or real
estate, and it can make contracts
even with its stockholdersfor
before the law it has all the attributes of a person. Obviously,
in order to form a corporation
there must be, first of all, a charter granted by the state. This
ordinarily appears today in the
form of a general charter in the
statute books, addressed to all

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

persons who undertake to comply with its terms. Here, as in the
case of the special partnership,
one must be careful to comply
with these terms strictly; otherwise it may be claimed that no
corporation exists in the eyes of
the law. It is true that in the case
of defective incorporation, where
a possible charter exists and
where a bona fide attempt has
been made to come under it but
through a technicality some act
or step has been omitted, the law
will recognize for most practical
purposes the de facto corporation- subject always to the paramount power of the state to object at any moment to its continued existence. There is always
danger, however, that any particular defect in complying with
the offer contained in the general charter of the statute book
will be regarded as more than a
mere technicality and thus prevent the corporation from coming into existence either de facto
or de jure.
In general, the formation of
a corporation has been greatly
simplified by most of the states.
Thus, they furnish standardized
forms for each of the steps necessary under the statutes. Difficult questions arise, however,
particularly in the phrasing of the
purpose for which the corporation is organized. On the one
hand, the purpose must come
within the terms of the particular statute of which use is to be
made. In some states this statute differs for one or more of the
following types of organization:
railroads, public utilities, money
companies such as banks and
insurance companies, manufacturing corporations, trading corporations, and corporations not
for profit. At the same time it is
necessary to make the powers
broad enough to cover not only
the immediate needs but all of
the probable needs of the
corporation as it carries on its
business. The failure, for ex-

ample, to stipulate the power to
hold real estate may or may not
be embarrassing under particular statutes and decisions for this
or that type of corporation.

(b) Masters Liability in Tort.
The rationale, therefore, of true
agency is simple: it is liability

(c) Distinction between
Principals Liability and Masters.
The difference between the basis of the principals liability in
contract and the masters liability in tort (the same person may,
of course, be both principal and
master) gives rise to this contrast: While it is, within reasonable limits, possible to avoid the
appearance of having authorized
an agent to act in a particular
way, it is by no means possible
through ones conduct to limit
his responsibility for his
servants acts. On the other
hand, it is possible so to organize ones affairs that a person
who might otherwise be a servant becomes for all legal purposes an independent contractor. The distinction between the
two is not always easy to draw.
Thus, if I hire a window cleaner
he is my servant. If I engage the
services of a window-cleaning
company, even if it is only a oneman company, my work is being
done by an independent contractor. In the one case I should be
liable to anyone hurt by the negligence of the window cleaner,

www.suspicions.com

and in the other case I should,
of course, not be responsible for
his acts. Accordingly, the courts
have laid down tests which are
helpful though by no means conclusive, such as the degree of
detailed control reserved by the
employer, the mode and basis of
payment, the general custom of
employment in connection with
particular service, and the names
by which the various steps in the
process of employment are
called.
(d) Undisclosed Principal.
Care in the matter of holding out
will not go so far as to relieve an
actual principal from liability for
the contracts made by his agent.
The law has developed a doctrine
of undisclosed principal. Such a
person may come out and claim
the contract at any time. On the
other hand, if he is discovered
he may be drawn out to bear the
burden of it. Nor is it practical
by any degree of care so to vary
the relations of a particular type
of agency as to deprive the public of the privilege of assuming
that the authority ordinarily exercised exists in any given case.
Thus, a manager of a branch
store, a traveling salesman, an
insurance agent, a real estate
agent, or an agent entrusted with
the selling of a horse, have come
in the understanding of the community to possess standardized
authorities. Where it is true, for
example, that the agent to sell a
horse presumably has the power
to warrant the horse as sound,
no amount of private instruction
of such an agent can prevent him
from so binding his principal
regardless of the fact that in
exercising such a power he is
going way beyond his rights and
may be answerable to the principal or to others for doing so.

employers with agents and ser-

2. The External Relations
(1) RESPONSIBILITY
IN
AGENCY. (a) Liability of Principal
in Contract. The responsibility of
a principal on the contracts
made for him by his agent proceeds on an entirely different
principle from the liability of a
master for the wrongs done by
his servant. As to the former, the
important question is always
whether the act of the agent was
within the apparent scope of his
authority. As to the latter, the
question is whether the wrong
was inflicted in the actual course
of the employers business. The
reason for the difference will
readily be seen if we take the
simple case of the owner of a
truck who has a laundry route
and who pretends, with the consent of the owner of the laundry
whose name appears conspicuously on the truck, to be an employee of that laundry. Let us
assume that purporting to act as
the agent of the company this
truck owner makes an offer of
settlement to the owner of a lost
laundry bundle. Let us assume
that on the same day the same
truck owner, while negligently
driving, injures a pedestrian.
Now, while it is perfectly reasonable for the customer to argue
that he would not have entrusted
his laundry to the truck driver if
he had not been led to .believe
that the laundry was responsible,
it certainly would be foolish for
the pedestrian to argue that he
would never have exposed himself to the danger of being run
down if he had not first read the
name of the laundry company on
the wagon.

based either on actual authorization or on the creation of the
appearance of authorization. The
rationale of the masters liability for the acts of his servant is
much more difficult to work out.
It is not giving effect to fault, for
it is no defense that the master
has exercised the highest degree
of care in the selection, instruction and warning of his servant. Historical explanations
have been sought and found,
going back to the days of slavery,
but the perpetuation of the idea
in modern law is no doubt due
to the acceptance of the casualties of business as an element
of the cost of doing business regardless of whether these casualties are brought about by the
failure of inanimate objects or
the limitations of the human
body.

vants are closely duplicated. The
standardization of the idea of
holding out, however, has gone
much further. Thus, in a trading
partnership it is possible to assert that the members of the firm
may bind the firm on commercial paper, and in other types of
partnership the assumption may
be indulged in that whatever is
necessary and usual in the conduct of a business is within the
scope of each partner s authority. The liability which each partner assumes in full, however, is
in the first instance a joint liability of the members of the firm. It
is necessary, therefore, in suing
a partnership to proceed against
the group, unless the ordinary
foundation is laid in law for an
excuse from including one or
more members of the group,
such as death, hopeless insolvency, or absence from the
jurisdiction. When judgment is
rendered against the group, however, it is available as the basis
for levying on the property of the
individual partners as well as on
the property of the partnership.
Equitable adjustments of the
claims of the private creditors of
individual members of the partnership have led to a somewhat
different result where a partnership is wound up and its affairs
are being settled in equity:
namely, that the partnership
creditors have priority so far as
the partnership property goes,
and the individual creditors have
priority on the non-partnership
property of the individual members. In the ordinary course of a
going concern, however, the
partnership creditors have the
advantage of priority so far as
partnership property is concerned and parity with other
creditors in their resort to separate property. This liability of the
individual partner for all of the
debts of the partnership is at
once the strength and the weakness of the partnership plan of
doing business. It furnishes a

very strong basis for credit; on
the other hand, it tends to
frighten away from a partnership
venture those who do not wish
to jeopardize all that they have
in it.
It is this desire for limited liability that has gradually driven
out the partnership in favor of
the corporate form or one of the
other substitutes for incorporation that have been devised with
or without the aid of statutes.
The limited partnership, the special partnership, and various
other types of statutory partnerships sometimes remaining partnerships in name only and having all the essential attributes of
a corporation, have been devised
accordingly. Some of these provide for at least one general partner with unlimited liability, but
in others there is no personal liability other than the risk of losing what is already invested. The
important feature in such statutes is the bringing of adequate
notice to the attention of creditors and would-be creditors as to
the limited nature of a partners
responsibility. The word limited
may be required in the name of
the partnership. Public record of
some kind and notices in conspicuous places, or other methods adopted by various statutes,
aid in giving this protection to
the public. The law so jealously
guards the publics rights in
these matters that a comparatively minor deviation from its
requirements may throw the
whole undertaking back into the
category of a general partnership.
In dealing with the liability of
a partnership to outsiders, a
question of more than academic
interest is presented when it is
proposed that a partnership be
dealt with as a separate entity or
a person, in the eyes of the law.
Theoretically, a partnership is
nothing of the sort; actually, the
law has made concessions which
in the aggregate tend to out-

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

weigh this theory. Thus, under
modern statutes partnerships
may sue and be sued in their own
name, they may hold and transfer real estate, and their funds
are, as already indicated, sometimes dealt with as if they had
been incorporated.
(3) LIABILITY OF A BUSINESS
TRUST. The liability of a business
trust and its owners to the outside world is theoretically a very
simple but unsatisfactory arrangement namely, that the
trustees are fully liable, as if they
were partners in the business.
They may, of course, seek reimbursement from the trust funds
for all payments that they are
forced to make in the course of
the business through no fault of
their own; but the beneficiaries
of the trust, who in point of fact
are the real parties in interest,
while the trustees are mere managers, are free of liability or of
any risk other than the loss of
the trust estate. It is of course
possible for the trustees to stipulate in all of their contracts that
they shall not be held liable personally and that the persons with
whom they contract must look to
the trust fund, and only to the
trust fund, for their claims. No
such arrangement, however, will
help the trustees in a tort action,
and of course it is impossible to
force this contractual stipulation
on all strangers who deal with
the business trust. The greatest
danger in such arrangements lies
in the likelihood that a particular court will look upon the whole
transaction as essentially a partnership in spite of the nice formalities written into the trust
agreement. Even in those states
which have taken the lead in the
recognition of this form of business organization, it is necessary
to be very careful to give no direct or indirect part of the control of management to the beneficiaries of the trust.

own name and is later abandoned by the rich parent corporation, the lessor is likely to find
it exceedingly difficult, if not
impossible, to hold the stockholding parent corporation responsible.7 On the other hand,
where a corporation was organized for the purpose of circumventing the law against the paying or receiving of railroad rebates, courts quite readily ignore
the fiction of corporate entity and
set out the natural persons
whose acts, thus laid bare, constitute a violation of the statute.8
In these days of complicated
pyramids, with subsidiary and
parent corporations, it is unwise
to dogmatize as to the possibility of hiding behind the fiction
of corporate entity. Public opinion has been stirred by the use
of that fiction for tax evasion and
has demanded remedial measures. Furthermore, the securities
and exchange legislation of recent days has tended to tighten
the responsibility of directors,
promoters, and persons who
control their actions, with reference to corporate issues.
3. The Internal Relations
(1) SIMPLE CONTRACT. Where
the form of organization is that
of simple contract, the widest
possible latitude exists in the
type of control that each party
to the bargain has over the other.
We discuss elsewhere (Volume VI)
not only the liability in contract
under ordinary legal procedure
but also the contractual control
of procedural law that is sometimes attempted in this particular use of the contract, as well as
in others. There are, however,
several limitations to the use of
the contract principle in the establishment of mutual control m
organization contracts. The most
important of these of course
grew out of the tendency to
change the labor relation from
one of simple contract to one
bearing the earmarks of status.

www.suspicions.com

There are other limitations on
the contract principle that sometimes lead to the adoption of
curious devices for the maintenance of control. Thus, in recent
years a great deal of business
dissatisfaction has existed over
the inability of the manufacturer
of goods, particularly trademarked goods, to control resale
prices and terms, although from
a practical business point of view
the retailer may be as much a
part of the distribution organization of a manufacturer as a
local branch manager could possibly be. This dissatisfaction has
led to a wave of legislation, particularly since the upholding of
the California9 and Illinois10 fair
trade acts, and the passing of the
federal Miller-Tydings Act, under
which it is now possible to make
contracts exercising this degree
of control, or even to bring it
about without the formality of
contracts. The law still prohibits,
however, exclusive agency arrangements in interstate commerce where the tendency is to
create a monopoly or unduly to
interfere with competition. It still
prohibits certain restraints on
alienation of goods after they
have reached the hands of the
dealer, and latterly it has added
a restraint on the freedom of
contract in the selling of goods,
based on the principle of nondiscrimination against competing dealers.11
These contractual limitations
have led to the use of more intimate business relations than the
simple contract calls for. Thus,
the independent dealer may be
converted into an agent,12 or
into a lessee of such property as
a gasoline pump13 or shoe machinery.14 On the other hand,
an employee in charge of a
branch may become converted
into a nominal independent
dealer bound to the former employer by the terms of an elaborate mortgage. To counteract the
advantage of increased control,

(4) LIABILITY OF A CORPORATION. The simplest of all the
theories of external relationship
is that of the classical period of
corporation law in America. The
stranger dealing with the corporation has no connection whatever with the stockholders or
even with directors. His claim is
purely that against the artificial
person- the corporation- and
unless it can be satisfied out of
the corporations property it
must go unsatisfied, regardless
of whether it be a claim in contract or in tort. In course of time,
a good many important modifications of this theory have been
worked out. There are, in the first
place, statutes which give double
liability or proportionate liability,
or even unlimited liability to
stockholders, particularly in such
institutions as banks.6 These
statutes are rather strictly construed with reference to the time
at which one must be a stockholder to come within their operation, the manner in which one
must proceed in order to take
advantage of the statutes, the
question whether the obligation
of the stockholder becomes a
contractual one that will be recognized everywhere or a penal
one that will be given only local
recognition, the question
whether a judgment must first be
rendered against the corporation, and so on. A more serious
danger, however, faces both the
stockholder and the director
where the basis of procedure
against them is not a statute but
the claim that there has been
some fault, such as fraud or irregularity in the actions of the
corporation or of the persons
proceeded against, on the basis
of which they owe reparations on
common law principles to the
outsiders.
In general, the piercing of the
veil of corporate entity is practically limited to cases of fraud.
Thus, even where a wholly owned
subsidiary takes a lease in its

69

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

there is in general the disadvantage of increased responsibility. Combinations may be
found, however, under which the
necessary degree of control may
be worked out under the law
without undue burden.

70

(2) PRINCIPAL AND AGENT.
The substantive law of the mutual duties and rights of principal and agent presents an extreme form of both control and
responsibility. The agent owes
the duty of absolute loyalty and
fidelity, perfect good faith, and
ordinary diligence, plus whatever
skill is contracted for expressly
or impliedly in connection with
his undertakings. In addition he
owes a strict accounting which
may be enforced in equity, or
even in criminal law, by drastic
remedies. His position is, in
short, a fiduciary one. The
principals duties to his agent, on
the other hand, are not fiduciary;
they are merely the contractual
obligation to compensate, reimburse, and give proper opportunities and facilities to the agent
for the performance of his duties.
But, of course, as between the
parties there is room for extensive modification of the principalagent relationship. The law takes
cognizance of the actual understandings generally entered into
in various types of agencies as
the basis for its assumptions in
particular cases. Thus, auctioneers, accountants, lawyers, factors or commission merchants in
particular lines of industry, various types of brokers such as socalled real estate brokers and
stock brokers, insurance agents,
advertising agencies, drummers,
mercantile rating agencies, and
a great many others, have taken
on a standardized business relationship and are coming to be
understood by the law as having
entered into certain detailed
standardized contracts with their
clients or principals.

(3) PARTNERSHIP. More standardized, however, are the internal relations in a partnership
largely because the law refuses
to intervene in the disputes of
partners unless or until they
reach such a point that dissolution is called for. Of course the
terms of a partnership agreement may vary the normal understanding that a majority vote
shall control, or that books and
records shall be open to partners, or that accounts shall be
rendered from time to time. But
even where the obligations of
partners to each other and the
nature of their power of control
in the business is great, it is difficult if not impossible for the law
to take cognizance of them except as the basis of alleged
breaches in the extreme or cumulative cases that come before
it eventually.
(4) BUSINESS TRUST. In the
case of trusts, control must not
be exercised by any act or vote
of the beneficiaries. Trustees are,
however, answerable in court for
mismanagement of the trust estate, but Courts are not willing
to substitute their own judgment
for that of trustees acting in
good faith, no matter how erroneous or foolish the judgment of
the trustees seems to be. Hence,
in general the control exercised
over trustees in a business trust
is the purely negative one of
checking misconduct. It is not a
policy-forming control.
(5) CORPORATION. Control in
the case of the corporation goes
to the other extreme of invoking
legal sanctions at every turn. In
the first place, stockholders control is exercised by voting, and a
great many complaints are
accordingly answered with slight
comfort by the suggestion that
the remedy is at the ballot box.
In recent years there has been a
great tendency to underestimate
the importance of voting

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

powerin fact, the power is
meaningless to a small minority
stockholder in a nation-wide corporation. This tendency has been
reflected in the actual legal setup of many corporations in which
types of stock have been issued
with limited or conditional voting power or no voting power at
all. On the other hand, voting
power has sometimes been accorded quite irregularly, from the
point of view of classical corporation law, to bondholders and
others in similar positions. Generally, in the American charter of
today, voting power is apportioned on the basis of the number of shares of stock held. In a
few instances the older idea of
one vote for each stockholder lingers on, but the modern tendency is perhaps in the direction
of cumulative voting systems
whereby a minority, by casting
all of its votes in favor of only a
portion of the candidates, is enabled to get representation on
the board of directors. In general,
the voting power of stockholders is limited precisely to the selection of directors. Exceptional
situations are created by some
statutes requiring the ratification
of extraordinary measures by
stockholders vote, and occasionally by-laws do the same. In a few
matters, the vote, or rather the
veto, of a minority stockholder
is important because of the provisions of the law requiring
unanimous consent to drastic
changes in the structure of a corporation. Thus, in the classical
corporation law of the end of the
last century it was not uncommon to find such veto power left
to a single stockholder in such
matters as changing the purpose
of the corporation, selling all of
its assets, or changing its capital structure. More recently there
has been a tendency to leave
such matters to the board of directors or, at most, to require a
ratification by a stated majority
perhaps two-thirds or three-

4. Readjustment
and Dissolution
When in the course of events
it becomes necessary to dissolve
or rearrange business ties, the
parties generally find one phase
of their relations in which their

preliminary plans were defective.
It is quite natural that when
ones attention is concentrated
on a venture which he hopes and
expects to prove profitable, all
darker possibilities will be
touched upon lightly or dismissed from the mind. Quite
apart from the psychological operation of such an uneven distribution of attention it would certainly be unwise to create unnecessary sales resistance by suggesting, in making the preliminary plans, all the possible evils
that might be encountered. Furthermore, those evils which
could be foreseen as possibilities
are the very ones that are least
likely to overtake a business venture. Consequently, at the moment of readjustment or dissolution, the parties frequently find
themselves in a situation inadequately provided for by their
original agreements. So far as
this is true, they are compelled
to resort to one of two sets of
ideas: first, they may dissolve or
rearrange their relationships by
means of a new agreement; second, they may resort to general
rules of law that become operative in the absence of specific
agreements.
(1) CONTRACTUAL METHOD
OF REORGANIZATION AND DISSOLUTION. At the outset, we may
well bear in mind that under the
contractual pattern of business
already described the contractual
method of reorganization and
dissolution predominates. Ever
so many questions that have
reached our courts as to the
rights and duties of the parties
after a dissolution have to be
answered on the basis of an
analysis of the agreement to disagree. It is quite possible and
even usual for the parties to
leave open an obligation to adjust errors and take care of new
developments or discoveries that
have their basis in the former
relation, especially if it is long-

www.suspicions.com

continued or complicated.
Thus, in the course of a
project, questions have arisen
between owners and builders
calling a halt to operations by
mutual agreement. What shall be
done with building material ordered but not delivered, with
building materials delivered to
the premises but not opened,
with material opened and not
used or only partly used? The
answer of course depends upon
the terms of the agreement dissolving their relations, express
or implied. Similar questions
arise when an employee is dismissed with or without cause, or
when he otherwise terminates
his relationship as an employee.
What of commissions on transactions which he has begun but
not consummated, or on transactions consummated under
which the following through of
the performance was delayed
until the happening of some
event or on a contingency? What
of the employees right to enter
into a competing business in
which he would use the knowledge gained in the former
employers business, and what of
his relationship established with
the trade while in that employ?
Again the agreement -if there is
one- embodying the terms on
which the employee operates
should be resorted to in the first
instance in answer to these questions.
Though this formula simplifies the numerous questions relating to dissolution, and suggests at the same time the importance of embodying in agreements of dissolution a good deal
more than the mere mutual
agreement to quit, there are situations in which the agreement to
disagree cannot be or at all
events is not used. It cannot be
used where the relationship between the parties is one in which
the public has a special interest.
Thus, to take a type of status
created by contract outside of

fourths of the stockholdersand
to give to the individual stockholder, instead of his former veto
power, a right to be bought out
at an appraised valuation if he
took every necessary step to protest against the contemplated
major changes.
Individual stockholders are
protected by the courts against
the bad faith or clearly unlawful
acts of directors. They have little
or no protection against what
they consider the bad judgment
of the directors or even their arbitrariness in such matters as
withholding dividends where bad
faith cannot be proved. The court
will not in general substitute its
opinion of how the corporation
should be run for that of the duly
elected directors. There have
been cases in which stockholders have succeeded in compelling directors to pay dividends,
but in every such case some element will be found other than the
mere arbitrary refusal of directors to declare a dividend. For
example, in the case of Dodge v.
Ford Motor Company,15 which
attracted a great deal of attention at the time, it was held that
Mr. Fords own admission that
his directors were holding back
earnings in order to accomplish
certain humanitarian ends,
rather than for any good business reason, was sufficient to
warrant the court in exercising
its visitorial powers and compelling the declaration of a dividend.
Had the directors merely insisted
that in their opinion it was for
the business interests of the
company to build up a surplus
at that particular time, it is difficult to see how a court could
have overridden their decision.

71

the business field as an extreme
illustration, no agreement between husband and wife can terminate the marriage relationship. In fact, where the court procedure provided for such cases
is used and it is discovered that
the parties have resorted to the
courts as a result of an agreement in which one is bound not
to contest the action of the other,
the entire transaction is not only
void because of collusion but is
also a basis for criminal prosecution.

72

(2) DISSOLUTION OF CORPORATIONS. Less extreme, of
course, is the situation involved
in the dissolution of a corporation; but, in general, the
charter given by the state can be
destroyed only by the formula
provided by the state. Any agreement among stockholders and
other parties in interest from
which this formula, whatever it
may be, is absent, will leave the
corporation alive or, if for practical purposes dead, at least unburied and ready to haunt those
who have left it so.
State laws usually provide
that for the surrender of a charter a reasonable process of publicity, such as notice to creditors
and advertisements for the benefit of the public, be utilized and
that reasonable assurance be
publicly given that all debts have
been paid and all proceeds properly distributed. The exact machinery for accomplishing the
reasonable assurance of these
ends differs of course in the different states and for different
types of corporations. Furthermore, there is a great deal
of difference between the dissolution of a solvent corporation
and of one that is insolvent. The
latter may require a court procedure in which a receiver takes
charge of the dissolution for the
greater assurance of justice to all
parties. There is likewise a difference in various systems and

rules as to who may initiate the
process of dissolution. For a going concern that is successfully
accomplishing its purpose the
traditional rule has been that any
stockholder could insist upon its
continuance. Gradually there has
developed a view that a majority
of at least a two-thirds or fourfifths have the power of forcing
a dissolution. Sometimes dissolution is provided for on the initiative of the state as a kind of
double penalty imposed on the
corporation for specific acts. Occasionally the initiative of the
state may be utilized without
specific reason under the clause
reserving to the state which
grants the charter the right to
alter, amend, or repeal the charter. But whatever methods are
provided by the statute law
which creates the corporation,
only those methods enumerated
by the law are effective. In the
absence of any law on the subject, for example, there can be
no dissolution or repeal of charter by mere desuetude.
(3) DISSOLUTION OF PARTNERSHIPS. What has been said of
the corporation applies to a
much smaller degree to the partnership. In general, partnership
can be dissolved by agreement
between the parties, at least so
far as the parties and those
claiming under them are concerned. But so far as the public
is concerned the result of partnership law may still adhere to
the acts of the parties. Thus,
unless persons are notified of the
change or dissolution in the partnership makeup, they can go on
assuming that they are dealing
with the original partners. A specific notice to persons who have
had dealings with the partnership and a more general advertisement in the newspaper for
the benefit of other members of
the public are generally deemed
sufficient. The situation is really
no different from that existing in

Suspicions News Magazine

ordinary agency. One who has
been an agent may go on binding his principal, even after the
agency has ceased, because of
the continued appearance of
agency, unless and until the principal has taken the necessary
steps, through actual or constructive notice, to avoid a continuation of the appearance of
authority in the agent. Special
types of partnership created by
law resemble corporations in
that one who has taken advantage of the special provision of a
statute may be so subject to the
terms and conditions of that statute.
(4) DISSOLUTION OF TRUSTS.
If the relationship is, in the eyes
of the law, that of trustee and
beneficiary, the public has a sufficient interest in the proper administration of the trust to require the courts approval of the
dissolution, but whether this is
insisted upon or not depends, of
course, on local law which frequently distinguishes various
types of trust.
If the organization or the relation between the parties has
been effective through a conveyance of real estate or such document as a lease or mortgage, an
effective dissolution may require
a reconveyance or other cancellation of a document in writing.
In all these cases, of course, by
effective dissolution we mean
one that will bind the public as
well as the parties. Between the
parties themselves, the simple
contract of dissolution may be
quite effectual in many of these
instances. It may even give one
or the other party a right to go
into a court of equity to force the
other to execute the necessary
documents for the completion of
the dissolution as to the public.
(5) TERMINATIVE OR CONDITIONAL CONTRACT. There remains for study that class of
cases in which dissolution is pos-

sible by contract but is effected
in some other way than by a clear
distinct contract of dissolution
made at the time of dissolution.
The most obvious case is, of
course, that in which an agreement creating a relationship
gives a power of termination to
one side or the other under various conditions and stipulates
what shall be done if and when
that power is exercised. The
original agreement may even
stipulate the time for the termination of the relationship or the
event on the occurrence of which
it shall automatically cease. Such
cases differ from those of agreements of dissolution already discussed only in that the terms are
to be sought in the original
agreement rather than in the
subsequent one. Practically, of
course, this difference may be a
very great one in that the original agreement may fail to foresee the situation that actually
confronts the parties at the time
of the termination of their relations.

(7) TERMINATION BY LAW. In
addition to these various acts of

www.suspicions.com

parties -either two-sided or onesided- that may terminate a relationship, there are some instances of termination purely by
operation of law. Death is the
most important of these - but it
does not terminate all relationships. Death, for example, does
not end a contract in the absence
of a stipulation to that effect, or
circumstances giving rise to the
implication of such a stipulation.
Of course, such circumstances
exist where one side is to give a
personal service. If A agrees to
paint a portrait for B and dies
either before he has begun the
work or while the portrait is in
process, As executor can
hardly expect B to accept a
completed portrait finished by
someone else in fulfillment of the
contract. If an employer or employee dies in the middle of the
term of employment the contract
of employment is at an end. Yet
there are other agreements in
which there is no such implication. Suppose, for example, that
I buy an expensive set of books
or furniture and agree to pay in
installments. If I die before the
last installment is paid, my estate owes the balance. Many contracts are made for things required for individual persons and
not at all for their familiessuch
as law books for the lawyer, or
medical books or apparatus for
the physicianwithout due consideration of the fact that the
contractual obligation continues
in spite of death. Of course, the
situation has been met in some
types of business agreement by
stipulating definitely what shall
happen in the event of death. A
rather curious limitation on the
power of contract to meet this
condition, at least in one way,
has developed in connection with
the advertisement of an installment furniture house that in case
of death of a purchaser without
paying quite all the installments,
under certain conditions a receipt in full would be given to his

(6) IRREVOCABLE AGENCY
OR PARTNERSHIP. A more common instance of the same kind
arises where, in spite of any
agreement to the contrary, one
party has a power to terminate
the relationship even though he
has no right to do so. This is
generally true of both agency
and partnership. A principal, an
agent, or a partner may in general put an end to the relationship, even though he had agreed
definitely not to do so within a
specified time, and even though
he lays himself open to an action
for damages by the breach of his
contract by terminating the relationship. Business men have attempted by their contracts to
curtail this power: in other
words, to make an agency or a
partnership irrevocable. Sometimes their effort shows itself in
the establishment of a penalty or
a forfeiture of an interest where

the power is wrongfully exercised. The limits of this type of
self-help or contractual control of
adjective law we have already
explored. The law does recognize, however, at least one class
of irrevocable agencythe socalled power coupled with an interest. A great deal of learning
has clustered around the meaning of this phrase. One of the
leading cases on the subject is
Hunt v. Rousmaniers Estate. In
that case an experiment was
tried for the creation of a novel
type of security: the creditor, instead of getting a mortgage, was
given a power to sell a ship and
reimburse himself for his debt
out of the proceeds. This substitute for the mortgage would
probably have worked out satisfactorily, either as a means of
pressure on the debtor or as an
actual satisfaction of the claim
of the creditor through the machinery proposed, but the parties
had not foreseen the complication that would arise if the debtor
died before the execution of the
power. Under the ordinary rule
of agency, death operated as a
revocation of a power, but it was
contended that this was a power
coupled with an interest. Chief
Justice Marshall ruled that is was
not, that the type of interest contemplated in that phrase as used
in this connection was only a
kind of part ownership in the
thing and not merely an interest
in the proceeds of the sale authorized by the power. The creditor was treated as an ordinary
unsecured creditor. And though
courts since that day have been
a little more ready to detect
present interest in the thing under any given set of facts, they
have continued to apply the rule
as laid down by Marshall once
they determine that the interest
in question is limited to the proceeds.

74

estate. This was interpreted by
an insurance commissioner as a
contract of insurance and, as
such, one which a furniture company was not authorized to enter into. Death likewise has very
little effect on the business relationships made up in the form
of contract in which the parties
are corporations rather than individuals; for though the death
of a partner terminates a partnership, the death of an officer
or shareholder leaves the corporation intact, with a new owner
of the stock and, at most, a vacancy in office for the filling of
which the law provides.
It is further possible to avoid
the effect of death on a contract
by stipulating that the contract
is made on behalf of the makers
executors and administrators, as
well as on his own behalf.
There are, however, some
phases of the operation of law
not so easily circumvented. Thus,
war suspends a contract and
other relationships between subjects of the warring states. Intervening illegality of the purpose
of the contract or relation by reason of a change in law will automatically terminate the relation. Likewise, bankruptcy, statutes of limitations, and the like,
may operate against the wishes
of the parties or of one of them
by reason of the supremacy of
the law.
(8) BASES FOR PLANNING
TERMINATION. Within the limits
of control of the manner of terminating relations, it remains to
consider the actual practice in
providing methods of termination for various types of relations
common in business. At least a
few general tendencies stand
out: labor relations are usually
made terminable at the will of
either party, rather than timed.
The reason is not merely the desire of the business man to retain control over his employee
through a constant threat of pos-

sible discharge, but the more
deep-seated fear of the business
cycle. Until some progress is
made in stabilizing industry so
as to avoid extremes of speeded
production and unemployment,
no time contract with labor will
commend itself to the executive.
In certain types of employment
there has grown up a practice of
requiring at least a short-timed
notice, such as the two-weeks
period in the standard actors
contract, and it may well be that
this tendency will manifest itself
more widely as a first step towards the elimination of the insecurity of the employee incident
to the present system.
There are, of course, business situations in which the very
opposite thing is striven for:
namely, where the power of terminating an agency or a partnership agreement is specifically
diminished or sought to be withheld by the imposition of a penalty or the actual creation of a
power coupled with an interest
for no other purpose than to
avoid terminability. Again there
are situations in which business
recognizes the propriety of giving a choice of continuation or
termination to one side. This is
present in the renewable lease,
where the mode of renewal is
through silence or through the
definite giving of notice. Business may further be interested
in the termination of relations in
case of bankruptcy or a similar
complication. Leases nowadays
frequently specify that, in case
of bankruptcy, a lease shall become terminable at the option of
the lessor. Just what is a convenient period for any particular
type of relation to endure is a
question of business fact depending upon customs of trade,
seasons, and cycles in a particular business, the length of time
required for the completion of a
deal or deals, the comparative
length of the period of preparation or training necessary to

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

make an employment or similar
relationship profitable, and the
like. In some instances, however,
the actual custom or practice is
controlled by arbitrary limits
such as the calendar year, or by
arbitrary customs such as those
which prescribe moving days in
various localities.
Just what events shall be
looked upon as terminating a
relation, and particularly as discharging a contract, is essentially
a question of interpretation, depending, like all questions of interpretation, on the actual words
used and their most likely explanation in the light of customs
and practices, past dealings and
other attending circumstances.
An interesting question in the
conflict of laws is raised where a
contract was made in one place
to be performed in another, and
a particular event occurs which,
in the absence of stipulations to
the contrary, would constitute a
discharge of the contract in one
of those places though not in the
other. In general it is safest to
view such situations as calling
for the intent of the parties. The
assumption is frequently indulged in that the intent of the
parties can be ascertained by
reference to the law of the place
of making rather than to that of
the place of performance, so far
as the question of discharge is
concerned. The matter can of
course easily be taken care of by
express stipulation, since the
difficulty is entirely one of interpretation.
Differing in many respects
from termination of the relation
is the alteration of the business
relation in view of new circumstances. It is, of course, possible
in many such cases to proceed
to separate stages: first, the dissolution of the former relation
and, second, the creation of the
new one. In very simple situations this analysis is practical
and convenient. In some, it furnishes an equitable basis for pro-

course of business development
provided they comply with such
procedure as the statute provides by way of substitution for
the old power to block change
for the protection of the minority stockholders. For example,
several states have provisions to
the effect that a two-thirds majority of the owners of all stock
of the corporation may sell the
entire plant and proceeds of the
corporation and, therefore, lay
the foundation for an eventual
dissolution, but that a minority
in such case if it objects to the
price at which the assets are sold
may demand arbitration and be
reimbursed for its share in accordance with the award of such
arbitration.
Where the differences of any
of the various factions become
serious, and particularly where
the creditors of the organization
are likely to be delayed in their
claims through the process of reorganization and are in a position to check or interfere with its
ordinary work, the particular legal device that seems most usable for the tiding-over process
is the receivership. The receivership is not in itself a remedy
furnished by the law or equity to
mend any situation. It is a subsidiary part of procedure applicable only in a case that is pending in the court or which gets
into court on some entirely independent legal or equitable
ground. Of course in a great
many cases there is a simple and
legitimate ground for going into
court, and the receivership can
be asked for by a party in interest in the ordinary course of
things. But in a vastly greater
number of cases of business
reorganization the thing actually
desired is the subsidiary device
of receivership, and the ground
for going into court is a more or
less trumped-up one. A friendly
suit is instituted by someone
having a technical claim, and by
the recitation of more or less fic-

www.suspicions.com

titious matter the way is paved
for a friendly receivership. In recent years the courts have relaxed their rigidity in requiring
an independent cause of action
and have come to recognize a
kind of non-litigious administrative function of tiding over the
period of reorganization and
watching the process so as to
safeguard the interests of all
parties concerned.
The inevitable result of the
process of adapting the old tool
of receivership for a new purpose
is exactly what we witnessed
before in similar situations.
There are numerous imperfections in the system. While the
umbrella receivership does
serve to keep things intact and
moving on the negative side, it
does not go very far towards a
solution of the difficulties if the
parties themselves are not willing to come to an understanding. At most, there is a threat in
the distance that if the parties
will not come together amicably
the machinery of foreclosure or
of some other drastic remedy
may be so utilized as to injure
all of them.
(9) FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY
LAW. Among the proposals for
further adapting the machinery
of the law to the business of corporate reorganization, the most
sweeping is that appended to the
Federal Bankruptcy Law as Chapter X. Reorganization is not bankruptcy in any traditional sense.
Nevertheless the emphasis of
bankruptcy law has shifted from
the quasi-criminal treatment of
the debtor to the processes of
rehabilitation in the course of
time. If we read the constitutional
clause which gives Congress the
power to make uniform the laws
of bankruptcies throughout the
United States, thinking of the
important word as the skin of a
living thought and not as a crystal, we may uphold the power
of Congress to take control of

Suspicions News Magazine

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

cedure even if the parties themselves have not taken the two
steps consciously and deliberately. Thus, in building contracts
in which unforeseen difficulties
have arisen and in the course of
which the owner promises the
builder an additional compensation to that originally agreed
upon, in the terms of his promise to finish the work, which he
is already bound to do, courts
have seen a way out of the difficulty of lack of consideration by
pretending that the transaction
had two stages and that after the
slate had been cleared by mutual
release a new contract had been
entered into with a new consideration for a new promise that
resembled the old one.
In more complicated situations, however, there is a real
difficulty involved in taking the
two steps or even in imagining
them. It is the difficulty of taking care of a complicated bit of
business machinery during the
process of transition. Even where
the reorganization of a business
is entirely voluntary, and where
it is dictated through no failure
whatever of business but simply
as an ordinary incident in its
growth, a period of negotiations
must be weathered in which the
maintenance of a status quo and
possibly a perfectly neutral temporary control may be important
postulates. If, as is quite likely
during this period, there develops a dissatisfied faction, be it
ever so small a minority, a truly
amicable reorganization becomes impossible. Our corporation laws, for reasons that antedate modern business, contemplate such a static condition of
business that they give a single
stockholder the power to block
any change in the articles of incorporation. In recent years statutes have been passed modifying this power of the minority
stockholder, so that a majority
can take steps likely to be profitable if not necessary in the

75

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

corporate reorganization under
bankruptcy forms. Congress has
proceeded in this matter cautiously by merely enacting the
procedure developed by courts
without statutory aid, under the
umbrella receiverships of recent years. It has, however, cut
away a great deal of red tape by
making the receivership and the
reorganization under it the thing
asked for rather than an incidental boon in a proceeding largely
fictitious. The essential thing
asked for by business is a respite
during which unhurried bargaining can lead to an effective plan,
and the aid of an impartial tribunal to see that the plan is fairly
arrived at and honestly carried
out. Nuisance value and
squeezing must be reduced to
a minimum.

76

(l0) THE EQUITIES. Above
all, realities must be faced to
apportion what the business
man has learned to call the equities, by which he means the
ultimate calculation of the extent
of the interests of all the types
of creditors, proprietors and
other claimants. Legal priorities
must frequently give way to business priorities. Thus it may be
vital to all parties to keep a business unit intact. In such a situation there may be a dispute
among those claiming special
interests in the various parts of
the business as to how they
should be ranked. Thus a second
mortgage on a plant absolutely
essential to an organization may
well take priority over a first

mortgage on a less essential
plant. Furthermore, new money
must be catered to at the expense of the old investors for
their ultimate benefit. And this
new money must be sought
where it can be found. Experience has shown that common stockholders, if given even
a slight, advantage, will frequently furnish that new money.
Creditors, generally, will not.
Hence it had been found impractical to refuse any such concession to stockholders where creditors are not paid in full, although
theoretically if there is any value
left in the enterprise it belongs
to the unsatisfied creditors. A
practical compromise has established itself: that such creditors
may not be passed over entirely
if stockholders are to be dealt
with. They must be treated fairly.

6

This arrangement is of
course not new. In early American
law, incorporation did not generally carry with it limited liability. It
was only some 50 years ago, in
the period which is here described
as the classical period of American corporation law, that the
limitation of liability became
nearly universal.

Some Frontiers of
Business Law

nation-wide rather than a matter
of purely local concern. The significance of size has become
acute, whether we consider the
question of an optimum size or
of the actual size of units. Associated with this question is that
of the relation between the investor or owner of an enterprise and
the management. Further, with
size and the development of absentee ownership has come a
new series of labor relations, as
different from the personal relations of employer and employee
of petty capitalism as those were
from the still more personal relations of the domestic system
of production. Specialization of
functions has given rise to a series of recognized types of trades
and even professions to do the
work formerly allotted indiscriminately to merchants. The attitude of Government to business
has, in course of time, undergone
many changes. Not only have
there been much heralded new
deals from time to time, but
imperceptibly, from time to time,
have state and Federal Governments and their agencies in-

www.suspicions.com

creased their direct participation
in business as producers, buyers,
sellers, competitors. Gradually,
too, have they extended the idea
of regulation of private business,
through officers and administrative commissions vested with
a high degree of discretion. Underlying these changes in the
attitude of Government we must
recognize not only new needs
calling for new methods, but increased knowledge leading to a
desire to conserve what was formerly wasted or protect interests
that had formerly been inadequately defined. Thus, the desire to conserve natural and human resources has led to interference with such concepts as
the right of property and freedom of contract, and may lead
to further curtailment of these
concepts, even in the absence of
drastic external changes.
2. Future Trend
of Law Development
The process of prophesying
the trend of legal development
is even more precarious than the
guessing of the future of natural

Suspicions News Magazine

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

1. Development
of Business Law
The processes by which the
law brought over to America
from England has been adapted
to the current needs of business
are continuing and likely to be
accelerated in the immediate future, in view of the rapidity and
the extent of the changes of the
demands of business life in the
world today. We have progressed
from a rural to an urban pattern,
even in rural communities. We
have accordingly become interdependent to a degree undreamed of in the days of the
rugged individualism characteristic of the pioneer. We have
accustomed ourselves to rapid
transactions, necessarily standardized to save time, expense,
labor. We have become adjusted
to mass production and its necessary counterparts, mass distribution and mass consumption.
Consumers have become separated from the producers who
supply them, not only in space
but through the intervention of
various kinds of middlemen.
Business has tended to become

77

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

phenomena, because of the human element, which is likely to
differ from time to time and from
place to place. Yet there are several steps that can be taken towards meeting the future of law
in such a definite area as American business at the present day.

78

(1) ESTABLISHED CODES OF
BUSINESS LAW. In the first place,
a distinction may be drawn between those parts of the law that
have been stabilized for the next
generation by codification or allied processes and those in a
state of flux. The drafts of the
American Commissioners on Uniform State Laws for Negotiable
Instruments, Sales, Conditional
Sales, Warehouse Receipts, Partnership, Limited Partnership, are
typical, but by no means exhaustive of the first group. There is
an understandable resistance
against amendments, however
good in themselves, that will destroy uniformity. There is, moreover, even in the absence of the
consideration of uniformity, a
reluctance about disturbing the
well-established expectations of
the layman, or his vested interests. Hence, major disturbances
are not common in American legislation in the main outlines of
real estate law or contracts or
even agency or trusteeship or the
torts most significant for business life. On the other hand, we
have less assurance of continuity in the essentially legislative
field of corporation law, or the
controversial arena of labor law,
or in the newly entered realms
of administrative regulation of
particular business relations.
These are todays frontiers of
business law.
(2) NATION-WIDE SIMILARITY OF BUSINESS LEGISLATION.
Within these confines there are
further limits resulting from the
centripetal forces that have heretofore prevented American state
law from developing into forty-

eight independent state systems.
Some of these forces are still
potent. There are, for example,
the nation-wide textbooks, encyclopedias, digests, periodicals
and other literature; the national
law schools and lawyers associations; the movements for uniform laws sponsored by lawyers
and businessmen alike; the occasional attempts to restate the
law of America, particularly when
practiced on the grand scale of
the American Law Institute; the
nation-wide character of pressure groups, including the organized mouthpieces of particular
industries and of labor; the imitativeness of legislatures; and,
operating through all these channels, the fundamental similarities
of needs and wishes throughout
the country.
(a) Statutory Waves. As a
result of these forces, business
legislation, even to a greater extent than legislation on other
subjects, has passed over this
country in easily recognizable
waves. In the social legislation
affecting labor relations, for example, that has been a major
phenomenon of the last fifty
years, there are distinguishable
several waves. First came the
early factory and mining acts
pertaining to working conditions
in the Eighties. Later, a growing
interest in the employment contract left us, in spite of resistance
on constitutional grounds, a precipitate of laws regarding hours,
modes and periods of pay, machinery for conciliation, mediation and arbitration, if not for all
industries and employees, at
least for those shown to require
the exercise of that exception to
ordinary constitutional limitations known as police power. In
the Nineties arose a series of
experiments for employers liability or workmens compensation, sometimes with a state insurance feature. Legislation
favoring unionism, establishing

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

or strengthening the right to
strike, to picket, or use other
weapons of organized labor without interference from employers
or employer-controlled organizations, has been typical of the first
third of the twentieth century.
The growing political power of
labor has been respected by legislatures in minor ripples of
statutory activity regarding a
hundred subjects ranging from
washroom facilities to a fair and
free opportunity to vote in political elections. In other series of
acts the laborer is protected
against exploitation by loansharks dealing in wage assignments, against crooked employment bureaus, against grafting
foremen, and various kinds of
intimidation.
(b) Federal Legislation. Federal legislation for men employed
in interstate commerce has heretofore followed the same models
as state legislation. Recent Federal legislation beginning with
the unconstitutional National Industrial Recovery Act and continuing in the Wagner National
Labor Relations Act extends to
all industry engaged in or affecting interstate commerce a rule
in favor of collective bargaining,
against employer interference
with employee organization. Further Federal legislation is directed at standards of hours and
wages. The significance of the
entrance of the Federal Government into this field of law is enhanced by three considerations:
first, the tremendous influence
exercised by Federal legislation
as an example for our mimetic
state legislatures; secondly, the
assumption that where the Federal Government has the power
of regulation, that power is plenary, and not to be measured by
the limited extent of state regulation allowed in corresponding
cases; finally, the recent holdings
of our Supreme Court giving new
scope to the possibilities of

reaching through the interstate
commerce power to activities
physically localized within a
state.1
(c) Federal Influences on
State Legislation. In addition to
these long-existing Federal influences for maintaining the essential unity of American law, there
has appeared in recent years a
tendency on the part of the Federal Government to suggest particular state legislation, and not
infrequently to back up the suggestion with an offer of financial
cooperation. Provisions in the
Social Security laws and inheritance tax laws, and administrative
action in the administration of
relief, are in point.

3. Time Element
and Business Law
A final consideration limiting
our survey of the frontiers of
business law is that of time. Are
we concerned with next years
legislatures, or the next revolution of the business cycle, or the
length of an average business
career, or the long process of
human evolution in which the
capitalistic system may be regarded as a stage? Obviously,
each of these time-schemes has
its interest and its significance.
To the labor leader on the fighting line, next years legislation
may be all-important and the
details of administration may
loom large. To the student of
economic history these matters
are of minor importance. He wonders whether our whole system
of contract will endure under the
incessant penetration of administrative interference into enclosures formerly considered sacred
to private agreement.
For present purposes neither

www.suspicions.com

extreme will be most useful. We
are concerned with as long a look
ahead as is practical in business
planning worthy of the name.
This period is perhaps longer
than most of us imagine. We
make long leases, we invest, we
buy insurance, we build, we create trusts, we incorporate, we
prepare for careers on the basis
of hurried assumptions about
the relative immutability of legal
systems not at all borne out by
facts. Let us consider, for example, some of the uncertainties
of future law involved in a fiftyyear lease entered into by a department store in a large city. We
assume that it will continue to
be legally possible to engage in
that business in substantially the
same way during that period in
spite of laws pretty definitely
aimed at curtailing the advantage of the large retailer both in
buying (e.g., the RobinsonPatman Act) and in selling (e.g.,
the so-called Fair Practices Acts).
As licensing laws increase, we
shall probably encounter new
difficulties in holding drug and
optical goods and liquor and
personal service departments
together in one organization.
One extremist in the New York
legislature has suggested that
department stores be required to
have a separate entrance for each
department, precisely as that
state already requires a separate
entrance for a liquor department.
But assuming that neither
law nor economics will destroy
the department store within the
term of the lease, what shall we
say about zoning laws, or expensive requirements as to safety
and convenience of premises, or
special taxes? What of the laws
power over the dollars in which
rent shall be paid? What of labor
laws or administrative regulation
of advertising and merchandising that may fall with peculiar
force upon such units? Bills have
already been proposed to divorce
manufacture completely from the

Suspicions News Magazine

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

(d) Federal Courts and the
Common Law. On the other
hand, one aspect of Federal influence towards uniformity
seems to have suffered a setback. Ever since Mr. Justice
Storys pronouncement in Swift
v. Tyson,2 there has been an
academic controversy over the
relation between Federal courts
and the common law. Conceding
that it was the common law of
the several states that they were
called on to administer, there
remained the practical question
whether they were bound to accept the view of state courts as
to what that common law was in
any state. A hundred years ago
Story was inclined to proclaim
that he knew better than the New
York judges what the law of negotiable instruments was in New
Yorkand he probably did. A
troublesome line of decisions
followed under which one result
could be expected in a Federal
court and another in a state court
supposed to be administering
the same law. This condition has
recently been ended by a Supreme Court decision.3 The result is a happy one, although it
does involve the recognition of
the supremacy of each state in

finding its own common law as
well as creating its own statutes.
Obviously, it was indulging in
a less violent fiction to insist on
the uniformity of the common
law in our several states in
Storys day than it would be today, and, in spite of all the leveling forces, we must look forward
to a condition in which it becomes more and more perilous
for the business man to cross
state lines equipped only with
the forms, franchises, authorizations and general legal outlook
of a single locality. In commercial law it is, on the whole, likely
that convenience will point the
way to greater uniformity than in
other parts of the law, but those
differences which will endure for
it will be all the more noticeable
and more important, because
ever since the days of Cicero it
has been recognized that commerce tends to seek a uniform

functions of a retail selling organization of this type. Of course,
it would be impossible to do
business if every far-fetched proposal were an object of fear. It is
precisely the necessity of discriminating between the farfetched and the probable prophecies about our legal system that
makes a study of some of the
typical frontiers desirable; and
hence we base our time limits on
this necessity.
To recapitulate: our specific
frontier themes are, (1) labor law,
(2) the administrative regulations
of particular business and (.3)
corporation law; our point of view
recognizes state differentiation
of details, but concentrates on
the waves of legislation and decision that the nation as a whole
experiences; our time schedule
adopts a reasonable period for
business planning, which, of
course, varies in different parts
of the law.

I. LABOR LAW

80

The labor law frontier may be
disposed of most readily. We
have already traced the history
of modern labor legislation. What
is happening today may be summarized under the following tendencies, by no means limited to
labor law:
(1) The departure from the
contract idea and the substitution of a new type of status law
for employer and employee regardless of the terms of contracts of employment.
(2) The increasing interest of
government and particularly the
Federal Government in labor relations.
(3) The increasing use of the
machinery of administrative law
in developing labor relations.
1. National Labor
Relations Board
The second and third fea-

tures of current labor law are
treated elsewhere in this work.
The National Labor Relations
Board can best be understood in
juxtaposition with other regulative boards whose early history
it is repeating. It begins by taking its tone from the agitation
that led to its creation precisely
as the Interstate Commerce
Commission did fifty years ago.
It proceeds as a prosecuting
body protecting one interest, labor, and opposing every other.
Whether it will reach the judicial
level of the Interstate Commerce
Commission slowly or rapidly,
with or without radical statutory
amendment, remains to be seen.
It is, however, necessarily experimenting and unearthing a great
deal of information not unlike
that unearthed in the first rate
cases of the Interstate Commerce
Commission. While litigation is
pending as to the exact requisites of a hearing under the statute or under the constitution, the
large questions to be encountered next are political rather
than legal, and there is no reason to expect a diminution of
Government interest in the welfare of the laborer in the immediate future.
2. Collective Bargaining
Our immediate concern here
is rather with the first-mentioned
feature, the departure from the
contractual conception of the
employer-employee relationship
that was universally accepted in
the middle of the nineteenth century. In our brief historic sketch
we spoke of certain statutory
modifications of the contract of
employment, such as those established by employers liability,
any contract to the contrary notwithstanding. What we are facing today in the ascendancy of
the principle of collective bargaining is not a new application
of the contract idea in labor but
a denial of it. The theory is that
however a person became an em-

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

ployee, his position gives him a
right to exert the influence of a
vote in a group after political
models. Furthermore, as in the
political models followed, the
majority rules. What the representatives chosen by this majority can do is not precisely to act
as agents and bind them by contract. Not a single laborer is
bound to work under conditions
approved by their representatives. The representatives are
certainly not bound, as under the
statutes they may be chosen
from outside the group of employees. If the employer is bound
by the results of collective bargaining, his condition is certainly
not to be explained on any traditional principle of contract law.
In its present stage collective
bargaining law is principally
negative. The employer must not
thwart group action on the part
of his employees by individual arrangements, by coercion, by interference, even benevolent interference in the affairs of their
organizations, and he must not
refuse to recognize their representatives or to sit down with
them for negotiations of the
standard basis of individual employment.
Of course, compulsion to
bargain collectively, however
likely it may be to lead to peaceful agreement, is by no means
synonymous with compulsion to
reach an agreement. It is theoretically possible to comply with
any number of mechanical provisions that the law lays down
with no intention to yield an inch
in the course of negotiations.
The task of the law is, therefore,
twofold. On the negative side it
must set the stage for collective
bargaining by preventing interferences with such machinery as
it sets up. On the positive side,
it must actually encourage honest efforts to reach conclusions
in good faith. Both of these objectives are more easily stated
and accepted in principle than

worked out m detail. Hence in
accordance with the general
legislative tendency of the day,
an administrative commission is
called into being with a broad
discretion both in rule making
and in enforcement. Needless to
say, the process entrusted to
them is complicated and delicate
beyond the aid of precedents
and, after all is said and done, it
cannot take the place of the actual haggling for points and positions that is implicit in bargaining.

II. ADMINISTRATIVE
REGULATIONS IN BUSINESS

1. Development
of Government Regulation
Most important among the
forces that have produced administrative law are the growing
complexity of both government
and business. The demands
made on government by business were comparatively few and
simple when our Constitution
was adopted a hundred and fifty
years ago. In small communities
people bought from manufacturers whom they knew personally. They dealt with bankers with
whom they had grown up as
neighbors. They employed relatives and acquaintances and invested in enterprises carried on
under their very eyes. Unfortunate members of society,
whether the victims of sickness,
old age, hard times or their own
folly, were taken care of by their
relatives, by private charities and
in rare instances by the state, or
they suffered. A few types of occupation were regulated or at
least subject to particular rules
of law: thus interest rates were
vigorously limited and the price
of bread and a few other necessities were here and there fixed
by statute. In most situations,
however, it was not only customary but quite reasonable to expect competition and the ordinary vigilance of the buying public to reward business virtue and
to eliminate fraud, incompetence, overreaching, irresponsibility, adulteration of products,

www.suspicions.com

traffic in deleterious foods,
avoidable dangers, unfairness
and oppression from business
life. This expectation became
less and less reasonable. Middlemen separated the manufacturer from the consumer. Boards
of directors and managers separated corporate owners from corporate employees. Great distances as well as complicated
forms of organizations separated
investors from the uses to which
their investments were put. Employment became a touch and go
relation. It began to dawn on the
country some time after the Civil
War that unless organized society would appoint agents to inspect and certify goods, examine and license persons, standardize and approve practices,
acquire and make public information on many subjects, regulate businesses charged peculiarly with a public interest, and
itself take over some functions
for which private industry
seemed inadequate, it would effectively be taking the side of the
worst elements in business
against the best. Competition
which had operated to raise standards under simpler conditions
would in blinder and less personal situations tend to drive out
the better, more expensive standards. This discovery is not to be
credited to any single political
party or labeled as the New Deal
of any particular year. It has been
a slow, continuous growth, the
result of endless struggles and
compromise, the work of men
who had neither the time nor the
aptitude to make the philosophy
behind their acts articulate or
ever consistent. In all these years
administrative control of business has generally been defended not as a good rule but as
a series of proper exceptions.
Today there is a tendency to justify administrative law as a rule
because the complexity of business calls for a more intimate
study of details and adjustment

Suspicions News Magazine

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

What has been said of the
administrative refuge of the law
in connection with the labor frontier may serve as an introduction
to the more general problems of
administrative law in relation to
business. Brave words were used
in the nineteenth century about
the freedom of all Americans to
engage in any ordinary business
or occupation without let or hindrance from any superior authority. Various traditions combined
to insist on a government of
laws and not of men. The due
process clauses of our constitutions were popularly and judicially interpreted as inconsistent
with much that the twentieth
century complacently accepts as
Administrative Law. Furthermore
the division of the functions of
government among legislative,
executive and judicial branches
implicit in all of our constitutions, state and Federal, and explicit in some, has made it somewhat difficult to classify Administrative Commissions either as
belonging to one of these
branches or as being a combination of several. Furthermore, a
doctrine prohibiting the delegation of legislative power had to
be reckoned with wherever
administrative discretion was

enlarged into a rule-making
power. That administrative law
has developed to its present proportions, in spite of these prejudices and restrictions, is the fact
that concerns us most here. It betokens a pressing necessity
which knew no law. In the contemplation of this frontier of
business law we should, therefore, consider the nature of this
necessity and the question of its
likelihood to continue to grow or
to diminish.

81

of means to ends than is possible
either in a legislature or a court.

82

2. Interpretation of Business
Regulation by Government
This survey points in the direction of continued development of administrative law in
business for some time to come.
From a practical point of view it
means that the business mans
rights and duties may be subject
to the discretion of commissions
and officers in such matters as
obtaining the original charter,
license, certificate of convenience and necessity, franchise,
permit or certificate without
which he cannot begin operations, for the terms under which
he may offer or advertise his securities or otherwise raise the
money needed in his undertaking, for the terms of his relations
with employees, bankers, customers, creditors, injured employees, public utilities and common carriers, for calculation of
his taxes, for building permits,
for approval of his safety devices
and sanitary equipment, to say
nothing of the indirect power
exercised by commissioners who
may lay down the terms under
which the government will do
business with a business man,
or who may enter into competition with private business or
grant or withhold government
aids, obvious or subtle. Of
course, the discretion of such
officers or commissions is not
absolute or final in all cases. It
must be a properly canalized
discretion; it must not be exercised arbitrarily, it must not be
exercised in an unstatutory
manner and the statute under
which it is claimed must not be
unconstitutional. Furthermore,
the findings of such an administrative body on law are subject
to attack in court; its findings on
fact-questions are generally
made subject to such attack
though they need not be; and
only its decisions involving a

genuine choice of policy within
a range of flexibility set by statute, are generally subject to no
judicial review. Furthermore as
administrative law is taking
shape and developing standards
for opportunities to be heard, the
quasi-judicial functions of administrative bodies tend to be isolated and made more like judicial procedure. The American Bar
Association is on record in favor
of a system of administrative
courts, distinct from ordinary
courts and also from quasi-legislative bodies. It has been suggested, with some plausibility
that a course of development
parallel to that by which Equity
became a part of the English system of the administration of justice, may make administrative
law in America an auxiliary
branch of the administration of
justice as it has been in fact in
Continental Europe for a century.
On the other hand, it must be observed that points administratively developed have been taken
over into statute or common law.
Furthermore since the very existence of administrative law implies a kind of abdication on the
part of courts and legislatures,
it is important to note the fact
that both courts and legislatures
have from time to time staged
restorations to temporarily abandoned parts of their authority.

III. THE FUTURE OF
CORPORATIONS
1. Blind Spots in Corporate
Structure
The last of our frontiers of
business law singled out for survey is in the field of organization
and particularly that part of it
which concerns the future of the
corporations. We have already
traced the increasing complexity of corporate organization
since the classical period of fifty
years ago. What concerns us now

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

is that this complexity has created what might be called a huge
blind spot in corporate affairs.
Contributing factors to this blind
spot already discussed are the
contractual deviations from traditional understandings between
the stockholder and the corporation, the holding company or
series of holding companies that
stand between the investor and
the subsidiary company or companies in which his money is
used, the magnitude and scattered location of enterprises controlled by nation-wide corporations, the complication of intercorporate relations often concealed rather than revealed in
long leases, mortgages, interlocking directorate arrangements and gentlemens agreements, and fin ally the antiquated accounting that was no
doubt ample for the needs of the
simpler days in which it was crystallized. No single easy method
can be devised to illuminate the
blind spot adequately, as the difficulty is inherent in the situation. Thus the so-called blue sky
laws that aim to make the initial
sale of a security honest (fraud
acts), or reasonably clear (publicity acts), or sound (licensing
acts), do not carry with them any
warranty as to later developments. Furthermore, if publicity
is relied upon and details are
piled on details in a public record
only the expert can read the reports understandingly and, after
all is said and done, all that can
be recorded or published is past
fact, whereas the goodness or
badness of an investment depends on unascertainable future
fact. Obviously, there is a connection between future probability
and past fact, but it is not one
that can be reduced to mathematical formulae.
2. Divergence
between Corporate Fiction
and Business Fact
Another source of confusion

one of Henry VIIIs attempted
abolition of the practice of holding land for the use of another
so as to facilitate his handling of
church and monastery lands.
A somewhat similar effect
may be aimed at in certain tax
measures. The abolition of the
practice of accepting consolidated returns for closely affiliated corporations may force certain companies to change their
structure so as to be able to deduct the book losses of one part
of an enterprise from the book
gains showed by another. A more
direct attack on one front of the
problem is shown in various attempts to stiffen the liability of
directors in the hope of ousting
directors who do not direct. Unfortunately, such efforts, particularly in certain blue sky laws including the Federal Security and
Exchange Legislation, sometimes act as a boomerang by inducing the resignation of responsible directors and the substitution of persons of doubtful financial responsibility. Another attack on the problem consists of
imposing liabilities not only on
directors and officers but on
those who control their actions.
The problem, however, is not a
simple one so long as the theory
of corporate structure is too inflexible to permit its reshaping
to correspond with business realities.
3. Substitutes
for Incorporation
Business has, of course, attempted to escape from some of
the rigid requirements of the
corporate pattern by experimenting with devices calculated
to bestow some of the benefits
of incorporation without the burdens. The joint-stock company,
various kinds of dormant and
secret partnerships, the Massachusetts Trust and various elaborate contracts that purport on
their face to be leases, mortgages or even sales, are the re-

www.suspicions.com

sult. In most of these situations
the advantage is precarious. If
the courts are lenient the legislature is likely to take the matter
up as in the provisions for taxing unincorporated associations
along with corporations. On the
other hand legislatures have authorized under protective conditions various kinds of partnerships with more or less limited
liability and other corporate advantages. These statutes may
perhaps be regarded as representing a stage in the evolution
of something between the partnership and the corporation for
moderate-sized business, preserving the flexibility and freedom of the former and yet giving the advantages of the latter
under safeguards that may be
adequate though not so cumbersome in theory or practice.
4. Federal Incorporation
and Licensing
The impact of the Federal
Government on the careers of
corporations raises one of the
most serious problems on the
business horizon. Heretofore
corporations have been, with the
important exception of national
banks and a few exceptions of
far less importance to business,
state-creatures that stood before
the Federal Government fullgrown. They were not citizens to
be sure but they were persons,
and as such entitled to protection under the Constitution
against being deprived of property without due process of law.
They even acquired one important prerogative of citizenship,
the right to resort to Federal
courts on the ground of diversity
of citizenship. The courts benevolently closed their eyes to
obvious facts and indulged in the
fiction that a corporation was
necessarily made up of citizens
of the state from which it held a
charter. In any event as persons,
corporations were subject to a
good deal of Federal control as

Suspicions News Magazine

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

in corporate affairs is to be found
in the divergence between various parts of the corporate fiction
and the realities of business. The
corporation takes over from its
governmental prototype, the
specially chartered company of
early modern times, a great many
of the features of a state or city.
Its officers are elected and in
many jurisdictions must take an
oath of office to qualify. Voting,
meetings, official records, the
official seal, the doctrine of ultra vires  all reflect this origin. For most corporations this
machinery is too heavy and cumbersome and elaborate for daily
use. For some it is too simple.
Thus, it is possible generally to
draw two organization charts,
one stating the business understandings and the other the legal theory of interrelations of
parts. The contract between
them may reveal that the directors are dummies, or bankers
representatives, the president a
mere employee, the treasurer the
virtual owner, those who have
lent money on bonds the actual
investors, or certain stockholders mere money lenders. Particular contracts with other corporations or employees may upon
examination be as fundamental
as charters or by-laws, so-called
surplus may really be working
capital; a subsidiary may be the
thing for which the parent corporation existsthere is nothing
unique about the Presidents discovery of a four-inch tail wagging a ninety-six inch dog. It is
unfair to jump to the conclusion
that there is any abuse involved
in these situations, though it
may be demonstrable that by
leading to confusion they facilitate fraud, and there may be occasions where the confusion has
been deliberately heightened for
sinister purposes. Sweeping proposals to abolish holding companies of all kinds or holding companies in particular industries
such as public utilities, remind

83

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

well as protection. With minor
exceptions they were gradually
brought under the Federal Bankruptcy Acts. Their interstate commerce was as fully a Federal matter as was that of natural persons. Hence the anti-monopoly
laws affected them and since
nothing so big as an effective
monopoly could be thought of
without incorporation, it might
be said that the anti-monopoly
laws were made with these statecreatures directly in mind. Nevertheless the mystery of their
creation was no part of Federal
jurisprudence. Chief Justice
Marshall had declared that their
charters constituted contracts
with states; but states in the
course of a century had pretty
well overcome the results of the
Dartmouth College case by the
insertion of the alter, amend, or
repeal clause in specific charters, in general statutes and even
in their constitutions. A changed
attitude of the Federal Government is discernible chiefly in the
Securities and Exchange Legislation. By the use of the interstate
commerce and postal powers
Congress seeks to take a controlling hand in the issue and marketing of corporate securities.
There is, furthermore, in the
death sentence legislation
against holding companies for
public utilities and in the control
assumed over the financing and
organization of railroads engaged in interstate commerce,
and in the amendments to the
Bankruptcy Act providing for the
reorganization of corporations,
an unmistakable indication of

increasing congressional interest
in the structure of corporations.
Proposals have been seriously
considered in Congress both for
Federal chartering and for Federal licensing of all corporations
engaged in interstate commerce.
Furthermore Congress has
experimented in its tax legislation with dictating a dividend
policy to corporations. Curiously
enough at the very moment that
it begins to frown upon subsidiary corporations it uses a parallel device, the government-controlled corporation for an untold
variety of purposes that would a
few years ago have been
achieved through government
bureaus. Some of these are federally chartered as well as authorized by Federal laws. Most of
them receive their charters from
states.
Much can be said in favor of
the extension of Federal authority over corporations. The failure
of the states to take steps to
make their laws on the subject
uniform, the freedom with which
corporations cross state-borders,
the actual practice of some of the
liberal states to spawn corporations for the obvious purpose
of engaging in business elsewhere, the tremendous need of
simplification and standardization of the relations entered into
by the purchaser of stock with
their corporations and with the
public, suggest the desirability
of Federal action. On the other
side, of course, every argument
that has ever been put forward
for the preservation of States
rights may be expected to be put

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

forward most emphatically by
billions of dollars of vested interests that may fear serious interruption to or even cessation
of their authority to do business
if the power of life and death over
corporations is centered in Washington. If any prophecy may be
ventured in such a titanic
struggle of interests, it would
probably be in the direction of
increasing Federal activity in
those matters which resemble
the issuance of securities in their
nationwide interest. If Federal
incorporation comes it will probably for a long time be optional
and rather in the nature of an
additional franchise than as a
substitute for State incorporation. Meanwhile the efforts
in the direction of simplification
and unification of State corporation laws are the order of the day
in the business world.

though the time of happening be
uncertain.
An instrument payable upon
a contingency is not negotiable,
and the happening of the event
does not cure the defect.
Section 5.An instrument
which contains an order or promise to do any act in addition to
the payment of money is not negotiable. But the negotiable character of an instrument otherwise
negotiable is not affected by a
provision which
(1) Authorizes the sale of
collateral securities in case the
instrument be not paid at maturity; or
(2) Authorizes a confession
of judgment if the instrument be
not paid at maturity; or
(3) Waives the benefit of any
law intended for the advantage
or protection of the obligor; or
(4) Gives the holder an election to require something to be
done in lieu of payment of
money.
But nothing in this section
shall validate any provision or
stipulation otherwise illegal.
Section 6.The validity and
negotiable character of an instrument are not affected by the fact
that
(1) It is not dated; or
(2) Does not specify the

signed by the maker or drawer;
(2) Must contain an unconditional promise or order to pay
a sum certain in money;
(3) Must be payable on demand, or at a fixed or determinable future time;
(4) Must be payable to order
or to bearer; and,
(5) Where the instrument is
addressed to a drawee, he must
be named or otherwise indicated
therein with reasonable certainty.
Section 2. - The sum payable
is a sum certain within the meaning of this act, although it is to
be paid
(1) With interest; or
(2) By stated installments; or
(3) By stated installments,
with a provision that upon default in payment of any installment or of interest the whole

shall become due; or
(4) With exchange, whether
at a fixed rate or at the current
rate; or
(5) With costs of collection
or an attorneys fee, in case payment shall not be made at maturity.
Section 3.An unqualified
order or promise to pay is
unconditional within the meaning of this act, though coupled
with
(1) An indication of a particular fund out of which
reimbursement is to be made, or
a particular account to be debited with the amount; or
(2) A statement of the transaction which gives rise to the instrument.
But an order or promise to
pay out of a particular fund is not
unconditional.
Section 4.An instrument is
payable at a determinable future
time, within the meaning of this
act, which is expressed to be
payable
(1) At a fixed period after
date or sight; or
(2) On or before a fixed or
determinable future time specified therein; or
(3) On or at a fixed period
after the occurrence of a special
event, which is certain to happen,

value given, or that any value has
been given therefor; or
(3) Does not specify the
place where it is drawn or the
place where it is payable; or
(4) Bears a seal; or
(5) Designates a particular
kind of current money in which
payment is to be made.
But nothing in this section
shall alter or repeal any statute
requiring in certain cases the
nature of the consideration to be
stated in the instrument.
Section 7.An instrument is
payable on demand:
(1) Where it is expressed to
be payable on demand, or at
sight, or on presentation; or
(2) In which no time for payment is expressed.
Where an instrument is issued, accepted, or indorsed
when overdue, it is, as regards
the person so issuing, accepting,
or indorsing it, payable on demand.
Section 8.The instrument
is payable to order where it is
drawn payable to the order of a
specified person or to him or his
order. It may be drawn payable
to the order of
(1) A payee who is not
maker, drawer, or drawee; or
(2) The drawer or maker; or
(3) The drawee; or
(4) Two or more payees
jointly; or
(5) One or some of several
payees; or
(6) The holder of an office for
the time being.
Where the instrument is payable to order the payee must be
named or otherwise indicated
therein with reasonable certainty.
Section 9.The instrument is
payable to bearer
(1) When it is expressed to
be so payable; or
(2) When it is payable to a
person named therein or bearer;
or
(3) When it is payable to the
order of a fictitious or non-exist-

ing person, and such fact was
known to the person making it
so payable; or
(4) When the name of the
payee does not purport to be the
name of any person; or
(5) When the only or last indorsement is an indorsement in
blank.
Section 10.The instrument
need not follow the language of
this act, but any terms are sufficient which clearly indicate an intention to conform to the requirements hereof.
Section 11.Where the instrument or an acceptance or any
indorsement thereon is dated,
such date is deemed prima facie
to be the true date of the making, drawing, acceptance, or
indorsement as the case may be.
Section 12.The instrument
is not invalid for the reason only
that it is ante-dated or postdated, provided this is not done
for an illegal or fraudulent purpose. The person to whom an instrument so dated is delivered
acquires the title thereto as of
the date of delivery.
Section 13.Where an instrument expressed to be payable at a fixed period after date
is issued undated, or where the
acceptance of an instrument payable at a fixed period after sight
is undated, any holder may insert therein the true date of issue or acceptance, and the instrument shall be payable accordingly. The insertion of a
wrong date does not avoid the
instrument in the hands of a subsequent holder in due course;
but as to him, the date so inserted is to be regarded as the
true date.
Section 14.Where the instrument is wanting in any material particular, the person in
possession thereof has a prima
facie authority to complete it by
filling up the blanks therein. And
a signature on a blank paper
delivered by the person making
the signature in order that the

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

paper may be converted into a
negotiable instrument operates
as a prima facie authority to fill
it up as such for any amount. In
order, however, that any such
instrument when completed may
be enforced against any person
who became a party thereto prior
to its completion, it must be filled
up strictly in accordance with the
authority given and within a reasonable time. But if any such instrument, after completion, is
negotiated to a holder in due
course, it is valid and effectual
for all purposes in his hands, and
he may enforce it as if it had been
filled up strictly in accordance
with the authority given and
within a reasonable time.
Section 15.Where an incomplete instrument has not
been delivered it will not, if completed and negotiated, without
authority, be a valid contract in
the hands of any holder, as
against any person whose signature was placed thereon before
delivery.
Section 16.Every contract
on a negotiable instrument is incomplete and revocable until
delivery of the instrument for the
purpose of giving effect thereto.
As between immediate parties,
and as regards a remote party
other than a holder in due
course, the delivery, in order to
be effectual, must be made either
by or under the authority of the
party making, drawing, accepting, or indorsing, as the case may
be; and in such case the delivery
may be shown to have been conditional, or for a special purpose
only, and not for the purpose of
transferring the property in the
instrument. But where the instrument is in the hands of a holder
in due course, a valid delivery
thereof by all parties prior to him
so as to make them liable to him
is conclusively presumed. And
where the instrument is no
longer in the possession of a
party whose signature appears
thereon, a valid and intentional

Section 19.The signature
of any party may be made by a
duly authorized agent. No particular form of appointment is
necessary for this purpose; and
the authority of the agent may
be established as in other cases
of agency.
Section 20.Where the instrument contains or a person
adds to his signature words indicating that he signs for or on
behalf of a principal, or in a representative capacity, he is not liable on the instrument if he was
duly authorized; but the mere
addition of words describing him
as an agent, or as filling a representative character, without disclosing his principal, does not
exempt him from personal liability.
Section 21.A signature by
procuration operates as notice
that the agent has but a limited
authority to sign,, and the principal is bound only in case the
agent in so signing acted within
the actual limits of his authority.
Section 22.The indorsement or assignment of the instrument by a corporation or by
an infant passes the property
therein, notwithstanding that
from want of capacity the corporation or infant may incur no liability thereon.
Section 23.When a signature is forged or made without
the authority of the person
whose signature it purports to
be, it is wholly inoperative, and
no right to retain the instrument,
or to give a discharge therefor,
or to enforce payment thereof
against any party thereto, can be
acquired through or under such
signature, unless the party,
against whom it is sought to enforce such right, is precluded
from setting up the forgery or
want of authority.
ARTICLE II.CONSIDERATION
Section 24.Every negotiable instrument is deemed
prima facie to have been issued

www.suspicions.com

for a valuable consideration; and
every-person whose signature
appears thereon to have become
a party thereto for value.
Section 25.Value is any
consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. An antecedent or pre-existing debt constitutes value; and is deemed
such whether the instrument is
payable on demand or at a future time.
Section 26.Where value has
at any time been given for the
instrument, the holder is deemed
a holder for value in respect to
all parties who became such prior
to that time.
Section 27.Where the
holder has a lien on the, instrument, arising either from contract or by implication of law, he
is deemed a holder for value to
the extent of his lien.
Section 28.Absence or failure of consideration is matter of
defense as against any person
not a holder in due course; and
partial failure of consideration is
a defense pro tanto, whether the
failure is an ascertained and liquidated amount or otherwise.
Section 29.An accommodation party is one who has signed
the instrument as maker, drawer,
acceptor, or indorser, without
receiving value therefor, and for
the purpose of lending his name
to some other person. Such a
person is liable on the instrument to a holder for value, notwithstanding such holder at the
time of taking the instrument
knew him to be only an accommodation party.
ARTICLE III.NEGOTIATION
Section 30.An instrument
is negotiated when it is transferred from one person to another in such manner as to constitute the transferee the holder
thereof. If payable to bearer it is
negotiated by delivery; if payable
to order it is negotiated by the
indorsement of the holder completed by delivery.

delivery by him is presumed until the contrary is proved.
Section 17.Where the language of the instrument is
ambiguous or there are omissions therein, the following rules
of construction apply:
(1) Where the sum payable is
expressed in words and also in
figures and there is a discrepancy between the two, the sum
denoted by the words is the sum
payable; but if the words are ambiguous or uncertain, reference
may be had to the figures to fix
the amount;
(2) Where the instrument
provides for the payment of interest, without specifying the
date from which interest is to
run, the interest runs from the
date of the instrument, and if the
instrument is undated, from the
issue thereof;
(3) Where the instrument is
not dated, it will be considered
to be dated as of the time it was
issued;
(4) Where there is a conflict
between the written and printed
provisions of the instrument, the
written provisions prevail;
(5) Where the instrument is
so ambiguous that there is doubt
whether it is a bill or note, the
holder may treat it as either at
his election;
(6) Where a signature is so
placed upon the instrument that
it is not clear in what capacity the
person making the same intended to sign, he is to be
deemed an indorser;
(7) Where an instrument containing the words, I promise to
pay, is signed by two or more
persons, they are deemed to be
jointly and severally liable thereon.
Section 18.No person is liable on the instrument whose
signature does not appear
thereon, except as herein otherwise expressly provided. But one
who signs in a trade or assumed
name will be liable to the same
extent as if he had signed in his
own name.

Section 31.The indorsement must be written on the
instrument itself or upon a paper attached thereto. The signature of
the indorser, without additional words, is a sufficient
indorsement.
Section 32.The indorsement must be an indorsement of
the entire instrument. An indorsement, which purports to
transfer to the indorsee a part
only of the amount payable, or
which purports to transfer the
instrument to two or more
indorsees severally, does not
operate as a negotiation of the
instrument. But where the instrument has been paid in part, it
may be indorsed as to the residue.
Section 33.An indorsement
may be either special or in blank;
and it may also be either restrictive or qualified, or conditional.
Section 34.A special indorsement specifies the person
to whom, or to whose order, the
instrument is to be payable; and
the indorsement of such indorsee is necessary to the further
negotiation of the instrument.
An indorsement in blank specifies no indorsee, and an instrument so indorsed is payable to
bearer, and may be negotiated
by delivery.
Section 35.The holder may
convert a blank indorsement into
a special indorsement by writing
over the signature of the indorser in blank any contract consistent with the character of the
indorsement.
Section 36.An indorsement
is restrictive, which either
(1) Prohibits the further negotiation of the instrument; or
(2) Constitutes the indorsee
the agent of the indorser; or
(3) Vests the title in the indorsee in trust for or to the use
of some other person.
But the mere absence of
words implying power to negotiate does not make an indorse-

ment restrictive.
Section 37.A restrictive indorsement confers upon the indorsee the right
(1) To receive payment of
the instrument;
(2) To bring any action
thereon that the indorser could
bring;
(3) To transfer his rights as
such indorsee, where the form of
the indorsement authorizes him
to do so.
But all subsequent indorsees
acquire only the title of the first
indorsee under the restrictive
indorsement.
Section 38.A qualified indorsement constitutes the indorser a mere assignor of the
title to the instrument. It may be
made by adding to the indorsers
signature the words without recourse, or any words of similar
import. Such an indorsement
does not impair the negotiable
character of the instrument.
Section 39.Where an indorsement is conditional, a party
required to pay the instrument
may disregard the condition, and
make payment to the indorsee or
his transferee, whether the condition has been fulfilled or not.
But any person to whom an instrument so indorsed is negotiated, will hold the same, or the
proceeds thereof, subject to the
rights of the person indorsing
conditionally.
Section 40.Where an instrument, payable to bearer, is
indorsed specially, it may nevertheless be further negotiated by
delivery; but the person indorsing specially is liable as indorser
to only such holders as make title
through his indorsement.
Section 41.Where an instrument is payable to the order
of two or more payees or
indorsees who are not partners,
all must indorse, unless the one
indorsing has authority to indorse for the others.
Section 42.Where an instrument is drawn or indorsed to

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

a person as Cashier or other fiscal officer of a bank or corporation, it is deemed prima facie to
be payable to the bank or corporation of which he is such officer, and may be negotiated by
either the indorsement of the
bank or corporation, or the
indorsement of the officer.
Section 43.Where the name
of a payee or indorsee is wrongly
designated or misspelled, he
may indorse the instrument as
therein described, adding, if he
think fit, his proper signature.
Section 44.Where any person is under obligation to indorse in a representative capacity, he may indorse in such terms
as to negative personal liability.
Section 45.Except where
an indorsement bears date after
the maturity of the instrument,
every negotiation is deemed
prima facie to have been effected
before the instrument was overdue.
Section 46.Except where
the contrary appear; every
indorsement is presumed prima
facie to have been made at the
place where the instrument is
dated.
Section 47.An instrument
negotiable in its origin continues
to be negotiable until it has been
restrictively indorsed or discharged by payment or otherwise.
Section 48.The holder may
at any time strike out any indorsement which is not necessary to his title. The indorser
whose indorsement is struck out,
and all indorsers subsequent to
him, are thereby relieved from
liability on the instrument.
Section 49.Where the
holder of an instrument payable
to his order transfers it for value
without indorsing it, the transfer vests in the transferee such
title as the transferor had
therein, and the transferee acquires, in addition, the right to
have the indorsement of the
transferor. But for the purpose

of determining whether the
transferee is a holder in due
course, the negotiation takes effect as of the time when the indorsement is actually made.
Section 50.Where an instrument is negotiated back to a
prior. party, such party may, subject to the provisions of this act,
reissue and further negotiate the
same. But he is not entitled to
enforce payment thereof against
any intervening party to whom
he was personally liable.

prior to the acquisition of such
defective title.
ARTICLE V.
LIABILITIES OF PARTIES
Section 60.The maker of a
negotiable instrument by making
it engages that he will pay it according to its tenor, and admits
the existence of the payee and
his then capacity to indorse.
Section 61.The drawer by
drawing the instrument admits
the existence of the payee and
his then capacity to indorse; and
engages that on due presentment the instrument will be accepted or paid, or both, according to its tenor, and that if it be
dishonored, and the necessary
proceedings on dishonor be duly
taken, he will pay the amount
thereof to the holder, or to any
subsequent indorser who may be
compelled to pay it. But the
drawer may insert in the instrument an express stipulation
negativing or limiting his own liability to the holder.
Section 62.The acceptor by
accepting the instrument engages that he will pay it according to the tenor of his acceptance; and admits
(1) The existence of the
drawer, the genuineness of his
signature, and his capacity and
authority to draw the instrument;
and
(2) The existence of the
payee and his then capacity to
indorse.
Section 63.A person placing his signature upon an instrument otherwise than as maker,
drawer or acceptor, is deemed to
be an indorser, unless he clearly
indicates by appropriate words
his intention to be bound in
some other capacity.
Section 64.Where a person,
not otherwise a party to an instrument, places thereon his signature in blank before delivery,
he is liable as indorser, in accordance with the following rules:
(1) If the instrument is pay-

ARTICLE IV.
RIGHTS OF THE HOLDER
Section 51.The holder of a
negotiable instrument may sue
thereon in his own name; and
payment to him in due course
discharges the instrument.
Section 52.A holder in due
course is a holder who has taken
the instrument under the following conditions:
(1) That it is complete and
regular upon its face;
(2) That he became the
holder of it before it was overdue, and without notice that it
had been previously dishonored,
if such was the fact;
(3) That he took it in good
faith and for value;
(4) That at the time it was
negotiated to him he had no notice of any infirmity in the instrument or defect in the title of the
person negotiating it.
Section 53.Where an instrument payable on demand is
negotiated an unreasonable
length of time after its issue, the
holder is not deemed a holder in
due course.
Section 54.Where the
transferee receives notice of any
infirmity in the instrument or
defect in the title of the person
negotiating the same before he
has paid the full amount agreed
to be paid therefor, he will be
deemed a holder in due course
only to the extent of the amount
theretofore paid by him.
Section 55.The title of a

person who negotiates an instrument is defective within the
meaning of this act when he obtained the instrument, or any signature thereto, by fraud, duress,
or force and fear, or other unlawful means, or for an illegal consideration, or when he negotiates
it in breach of faith, or under
such circumstances as amount to
a fraud.
Section 56.To constitute
notice of an infirmity in the
instrument or defect in the title
of the person negotiating the
same, the person to whom it is
negotiated must have had actual
knowledge of the infirmity or
defect, or knowledge of such
facts that his action in taking the
instrument amounted to bad
faith.
Section 57.A holder in due
course holds the instrument free
from any defect of title of prior
parties, and free from defenses
available to prior parties among
themselves, and may enforce
payment of the instrument for
the full amount thereto against
all parties liable thereon.
Section 58.In the hands of
any holder other than a holder
in due course, a negotiable instrument is subject to the same
defenses as if it were non-negotiable. But a holder who derives
his title through a holder in due
course, and who is not himself a
party to any fraud or illegality affecting the instrument, has all
the rights of such former holder
in respect of all parties prior to
the latter.
Section 59.Every holder is
deemed prima facie to be a
holder in due course; but when
it is shown that the title of any
person who has negotiated the
instrument was defective, the
burden is on the holder to prove
that he or some person under
whom he claims acquired the
title as holder in due course. But
the last-mentioned rule does not
apply in favor of a party who became bound on the instrument

able to the order of a third person, he is liable to the payee and
to all subsequent parties.
(2) If the instrument is payable to the order of the maker or
drawer, or is payable to bearer,
he is liable to all parties subsequent to the maker or drawer.
(3) If he signs for the accommodation of the payee, he is liable to all parties subsequent to
the payee.
Section 65.Every person
negotiating an instrument by delivery or by a qualified indorsement, warrants
(1) That the instrument is
genuine and in all respects what
it purports to be;
(2) That he has a good title
to it;
(3) That all prior parties had
capacity to contract;
(4) That he has no knowledge of any fact which would
impair the validity of the instrument or render it valueless.
But when the negotiation is
by delivery only, the warranty extends in favor of no holder other
than the immediate transferee.
The provisions of subdivision
three of this section do not apply to persons negotiating public or corporation securities,
other than bills and notes.
Section 66.Every indorser
who indorses without qualification, warrants to all subsequent
holders in due course:
(1) The matters and things
mentioned in subdivisions one,
two, and three of the next preceding section; and
(2) That the instrument is at
the time of his indorsement valid
and subsisting.
And, in addition, he engages
that on due presentment, it shall
be accepted or paid, or both, as
the case may be, according to its
tenor, and that if it be dishonored, and the necessary proceedings on dishonor be duly taken,
he will pay the amount thereof
to the holder, or to any subsequent indorser who may be com-

pelled to pay it.
Section 67.Where a person
places his indorsement on an instrument negotiable by delivery
he incurs all the liabilities of an
indorser.
Section 68.As respects one
another, indorsers are liable
prima facie in the order in which
they indorse; but evidence is admissible to show that as between
or among themselves they have
agreed otherwise. Joint payees or
joint indorsees who indorse are
deemed to indorse jointly and
severally.
Section 69.Where a broker
or other agent negotiates an instrument without indorsement,
he incurs all the liabilities prescribed by section sixty-five of
this act, unless he discloses the
name of his principal, and the
fact that he is acting only as
agent.
ARTICLE VI. PRESENTMENT
FOR PAYMENT
Section 70.Presentment for
payment is not necessary in order to charge the person primarily liable on the instrument; but
if the instrument is, by its terms,
payable at a special place, and
he is able and willing to pay it
there at maturity, such ability
and willingness are equivalent to
a tender of payment upon his
part. But except as herein otherwise provided, presentment for
payment is necessary in order to
charge the drawer and indorsers.
Section 71.Where the instrument is not payable on demand, presentment must he
made on the day it falls due.
Where it is payable on demand,
presentment must be made
within a reasonable time after its
issue, except that in the case of
a bill of exchange, presentment
for payment will be sufficient if
made within a reasonable time
after the last negotiation thereof.
Section 72.Presentment for
payment, to be sufficient, must

is specified in the instrument and
it is there presented;

and it is there presented;
(3) Where no place of payment is specified and no address
is given and the instrument is

(4) In any other case if presented to the person to make
payment wherever he can be
found, or if presented at his last
known place of business or residence.
Section 74.The instrument
must be exhibited to the person
from whom payment is demanded, and when it is paid
must be delivered up to the party
paying it.
Section 75.Where the instrument is payable at a bank,
presentment for payment must
be made during banking hours,
unless the person to make payment has no funds there to meet
it at any time during the day, in
which case presentment at any
hour before the bank is closed
on that day is sufficient.
Section 76.Where the person primarily liable on the instrument is dead, and no place of
payment is specified, presentment for payment must be made
to his personal representative if

(2) Presentment is excused
and the instrument is overdue
and unpaid.
Section 84.Subject to the
provisions of this act, when the
instrument is dishonored by nonpayment, an immediate right of
recourse to all parties secondarily liable thereon accrues to the
holder.
Section 85.Every negotiable instrument is payable at
the time fixed therein without
grace. When the day of maturity
falls upon Sunday, or a holiday,
the instrument is payable on the
next succeeding business day.
Instruments falling due on Saturday are to be presented for
payment on the next succeeding
business day, except that instruments payable on demand may,
at the option of the holder, be
presented for payment before
twelve oclock noon on Saturday
when that entire day is not a holiday.
Section 86.Where the instrument is payable at a fixed
period after date, after sight, or
after the happening of a specified event, the time of payment
is determined by excluding the
day from which the time is to
begin to run, and by including
the date of payment.
Section 87.Where the instrument is made payable at a
bank it is equivalent to an order
to the bank to pay the same for
the account of the principal
debtor thereon.
Section 88.Payment is
made in due course when it is
made at or after the maturity of
the instrument to the holder
thereof in good faith and without notice that his title is defective.
ARTICLE VII.
NOTICE OF DISHONOR
Section 89.Except as
herein otherwise provided, when
a negotiable instrument has
been dishonored by non-acceptance or non-payment, notice of

www.suspicions.com

dishonor must be given to the
drawer and to each indorser, and
any drawer or indorser to whom
such notice is not given is discharged.
Section 90The notice may
be given by or on behalf of the
holder, or by or on behalf of any
party to the instrument who
might be compelled to pay it to
the holder, and who, upon taking it up would have a right to
reimbursement from the party to

holder, it enures for the benefit
of all subsequent holders and all
prior parties who have a right of
recourse against the party to
whom it is given.
Section 93.Where notice is
given by or on behalf of a party
entitled to give notice, it enures
for the benefit of the holder and
all parties subsequent to the
party to whom notice is given.
Section 94.Where the instrument has been dishonored in
the hands of an agent, he may
either himself give notice to the
parties liable thereon, or he may
give notice to his principal. If he
give notice to his principal, he
must do so within the same time
as if he were the holder, and the
principal upon the receipt of
such notice has himself the same
time for giving notice as if the
agent had been an independent
holder.
Section 95.A written notice
need not be signed, and an insufficient written notice may be
supplemented and validated by
verbal communication. A misdescription of the instrument does
not vitiate the notice unless the
party to whom the notice is given
is in fact misled thereby.
Section 96.The notice may

to charge an indorser where the
instrument was made or accepted for his accommodation
and he has no reason to expect
that the instrument will be paid
if presented.
Section 81.Delay in making
presentment for payment is excused when the delay is caused
by circumstances beyond the
control of the holder, and not
imputable to his default, misconduct, or negligence. When the
cause of delay ceases to operate,
presentment must be made with
reasonable diligence.
Section 82Presentment for

notice to antecedent parties that
the holder has after the dishonor.

signature, notice of dishonor
must be sent to that address; but

arrived, or after the omission to
give due notice, and the waiver

parties; but where it is written
above the signature of an indorser, it binds him only.

diligence, it cannot be given to

Section 119.A negotiable
instrument is discharged:
(1) By payment in due course
by or on behalf of the principal

debtor;
(2) By payment in due course
by the party accommodated,
where the instrument is made or
accepted for accommodation;
(3) By the intentional cancellation thereof by the holder;

for the payment of money;
(5) When the principal debtor

Section 120.A person secondarily liable on the instrument
is discharged:
(1) By any act which discharges the instrument;
(2) By the intentional cancellation of his signature by the
holder;
(3) By the discharge of a prior
party;
(4) By a valid tender of payment made by a prior party;
(5) By a release of the principal debtor, unless the holders
right of recourse against the
party secondarily liable is expressly reserved;
(6) By any agreement binding
upon the holder to extend the
time of payment, or to postpone
the holders right to enforce the
instrument, unless made with
the assent of the party secondarily liable, or unless the right of
recourse against such party is
expressly reserved.
Section 121.Where the instrument is paid by a party
secondarily liable thereon, it is
not discharged; but the party so
paying it is remitted to his former
rights as regards all prior parties,
and he may strike out his own
and
all
subsequent
indorsements, and again negotiate the instrument, except:

Section 122.The holder
may expressly renounce his
rights against any party to the
instrument, before, at or after its
maturity. An absolute and unconditional renunciation of his rights
against the principal debtor
made at or after the maturity of
the instrument discharges the
instrument. But a renunciation
does not affect the rights of a
holder in due course without
notice. A renunciation must be
in writing, unless the instrument
is delivered up to the person primarily liable thereon.
Section 123.A cancellation
made unintentionally, or under
a mistake or without the authority of the holder, is inoperative;
but where an instrument or any
signature thereon appears to
have been cancelled the burden
of proof lies on the party who
alleges that the cancellation was
made unintentionally, or under
a mistake or without authority.
Section 124.Where a negotiable instrument is materially
altered without the assent of all
parties liable thereon, it is
avoided, except as against a
party who has himself made, authorized or assented to the alteration, and subsequent indorsers.
But when an instrument has
been materially altered and is in
the hands of a holder in due
course, not a party to the alteration, he may enforce payment
thereof according to its original
tenor.
Section 125.Any alteration
which changes:
(1) The date;
(2) The sum payable, either
for principal or interest;
(3) The time or place of payment;
(4) The number or the relations of the parties;

in which payment is to be made;
Or which adds a place of payment where no place of payment
is specified, or any other change

person to whom the instrument
is presented for payment;
(3) Where the instrument
was made or accepted for his accommodation.
Section 116.Where due
notice of dishonor by non-acceptance has been given, notice of
a subsequent dishonor by nonpayment is not necessary, unless
in the meantime the instrument
has been accepted.
Section 117.An omission
to give notice of dishonor by nonacceptance does not prejudice
the rights of a holder in due
course subsequent to the omission.
Section 118.Where any negotiable instrument has been
dishonored it may be protested
for non-acceptance or non-payment, as the case may be; but
protest is not required except in

TITLE 11.
BILLS OF EXCHANGE

ARTICLE II.ACCEPTANCE
Section 132.The acceptance of a bill is the signification
by the drawee of his assent to
the order of the drawer. The acceptance must be in writing and
signed by the drawee. It must not
express that the drawee will perform his promise by any other
means than the payment of
money.
Section 133.The holder of
a bill presenting the same for
acceptance may require that the
acceptance be written on the bill,
and, if such request is refused,
may treat the bill as dishonored.
Section 134.Where an acceptance is written on a paper
other than the bill itself, it does
not bind the acceptor except in
favor of a person to whom it is
shown and who, on the faith
thereof, receives the bill for
value.
Section 135.An unconditional promise in writing to accept a bill before it is drawn is
deemed an actual acceptance in
favor of every person who, upon
the faith thereof, receives the bill
for value.
Section 136.The drawee is
allowed twenty-four hours after
presentment, in which to decide
whether or not he will accept the
bill; but the acceptance, if given,
dates as of the day of presentation.
Section 137.Where a
drawee to whom a bill is delivered for acceptance destroys the
same, or refuses within twentyfour hours after such delivery, or
within such other period as the
holder may allow, to return the
bill accepted or non-accepted to
the holder he will be deemed to
have accepted the same.

ARTICLE I.FORM AND
INTERPRETATION
Section 126.A bill of exchange is an unconditional order
in writing addressed by one person to another, signed by the
person giving it, requiring the
person to whom it is addressed
to pay on demand or at a fixed
or determinable future time a
sum certain in money to order
or to bearer.
Section 127.A bill of itself
does not operate as an assignment the funds in the hands of
the drawee available for the payment thereof, and the drawee is
not liable on the bill unless and
until he accepts the same.
Section 128.A bill may be
addressed to two or more drawees jointly, whether they are partners or not; but not to two or
more drawees in the alternative
or in succession.
Section 129.An inland bill
of exchange is a bill which is, or
on its face purports to be, both
drawn and payable within this
state. Any other bill is a foreign
bill. Unless the contrary appears
on the face of the bill, the holder
may treat it as an inland bill.
Section 130.Where in a bill
drawer and drawee are the same
person, or where the drawee is a
fictitious person, or a person not
having capacity to contract, the
holder may treat the instrument,
at his option, either as a bill of
exchange or a promissory note.
Section 131.The drawer of
a bill and any indorser may insert thereon the name of a person to whom the holder may resort in case of need, that is to
say, in case the bill is dishonored
by non-acceptance or non-payment. Such person is called the

otherwise incomplete, or when it
is overdue, or after it has been
dishonored by a previous refusal
to accept, or by nonpayment. But
when a bill payable after sight is
dishonored by nonacceptance
and the drawee subsequently accepts it, the holder, in the absence of any different agreement, is entitled to have the bill
accepted as of the date of the
first presentment.
Section 139.An acceptance
is either general or qualified. A
general acceptance assents without qualification to the order of
the drawer. A qualified acceptance in express terms varies the
effect of the bill as drawn.
Section 140.An acceptance
to pay at a particular place is a
general acceptance, unless it
expressly states that the bill is
to be paid there only and not
elsewhere.
Section 141.An acceptance
is qualified, which is:
(1) Conditional, that is to
say, which makes payment by the
acceptor dependent on the fulfillment of a condition therein
stated;
(2) Partial, that is to say, an
acceptance to pay part only of
the amount for which the bill is
drawn;
(3) Local, that is to say, an
acceptance to pay only at a particular place;
(4) Qualified as to time;
(5) The acceptance of some
one or more of the drawees, but
not of all.
Section 142.The holder
may refuse to take a qualified acceptance, and if he does not obtain an unqualified acceptance,
he may treat the bill as dishonored by non-acceptance. Where
a qualified acceptance is taken,
the drawer and indorsers are discharged from liability on the bill,
unless they have expressly or
impliedly authorized the holder
to take a qualified acceptance, or
subsequently assent thereto.
When the drawer or an indorser

receives notice of a qualified acceptance, he must, within a reasonable time, express his dissent
to the holder, or he will be
deemed to have assented
thereto.

and no presentment for payment
is necessary.
ARTICLE IV.PROTEST
Section 152.Where a foreign bill, appearing on its face
to be such is dishonored by nonacceptance, it must be duly protested for non-acceptance, and
where such a bill which has not
previously been dishonored by
non-acceptance is dishonored by
non-payment, it must be duly
protested for non-payment. If it
is not so protested, the drawer
and indorsers are discharged.

its face to be a foreign bill, protest thereof in case of dishonor
is unnecessary.

or
(2) Where the bill expressly
stipulates that it shall be presented for acceptance; or

herein otherwise provided, the
holder of a bill which is required
by the next preceding section to
be presented for acceptance
must either present it for acceptance or negotiate it within a reasonable time. If he fails to do so,

holder of a bill drawn payable
elsewhere than at the place of
business or the residence of the
drawee has not time with the
exercise of reasonable diligence
to present the bill for acceptance

on the day that it falls due, the
delay caused by presenting the
bill for acceptance before presenting it for payment is excused, and does not discharge
the drawers and indorsers.

for acceptance is excused, and a
bill may be treated as dishonored
by non-acceptance, in either of
the following cases:
(1) Where the drawee is dead,

has been protested for non-acceptance may be subsequently
protested for non-payment.
Section 158.Where the acceptor has been adjudged a
bankrupt or an insolvent or has
made an assignment for the benefit of creditors, before the bill
matures, the holder may cause
the bill to be protested for better security against the drawer
and indorsers.
Section 159.Protest is dispensed with by any circumstances which would dispense
with notice of dishonor. Delay in

ceases to operate, the bill must
be noted or protested with reasonable diligence.
Section 160.When a bill is

property is in the name of one

passes to the buyer, without any
fault of the seller or the buyer,
part of the goods perish or the
whole or a material part of the
goods so deteriorate in quality
as to be substantially changed in
character, the buyer may at his
option treat the contract:
(a) As avoided, or
(b) As binding the seller to
transfer the property in all of the
existing goods or in so much
thereof as have not deteriorated,
and as binding the buyer to pay
the full agreed price if the contract was indivisible, or to pay the
agreed price for so much of the
goods as the seller, by the
buyers option, is bound to transfer if the contract was divisible.
THE PRICE
Section 9. Definition and Ascertainment of Price.
(1) The price may be fixed by
the contract, or may be left to be
fixed in such manner as may be
agreed, or it may be determined
by the course of dealing between
the parties.
(2) The price may be made

payable in any personal property.
(3) Where transferring or
promising to transfer any interest in real estate constitutes the
whole or part of the consideration for transferring or for
promising to transfer the property in goods, this act shall not
apply.
(4) Where the price is not
determined in accordance with
the foregoing provisions the
buyer must pay a reasonable
price. What is a reasonable price
is a question of fact dependent
on the circumstances of each
particular case.
Section 10. Sale at a Valuation.
(1) Where there is a contract
to sell or a sale of goods at a
price or on terms to be fixed by
a third person, and such third
person without fault of the seller
or the buyer, cannot or does not
fix the price or terms, the contract or the sale is thereby
avoided; but if the goods or any
part thereof have been delivered
to and appropriated by the buyer
he must pay a reasonable price
therefor.
(2) Where such third person
is prevented from fixing the price
or terms by fault of the seller or
the buyer, the party not in fault
may have such remedies against
the party in fault as are allowed
by Parts IV and V of this act.
CONDITIONS
AND WARRANTIES
Section 11. Effect of Conditions.
(1) Where the obligation of
either party to a contract to sell
or a sale is subject to any condition which is not performed, such
party may refuse to proceed with
the contract or sale or he may
waive performance of the condition. If the other party has promised that the condition should
happen or be performed, such

first mentioned party may also
treat the non-performance of the
condition as a breach of warranty.
(2) Where the property in the
goods has not passed, the buyer
may treat the fulfillment by the
seller of his obligation to furnish
goods as described and as warranted expressly or by implication in the contract to sell as a
condition of the obligation of the
buyer to perform his promise to
accept and pay for the goods.
Section 12. Definition of Express Warranty.Any affirmation
of fact or any promise by the
seller relating to the goods is an
express warranty if the natural
tendency of such affirmation or
promise is to induce the buyer
to purchase the goods, and if the
buyer purchases the goods relying thereon. No affirmation of the
value of the goods, nor any statement purporting to be a statement of the sellers opinion only
shall be construed as a warranty.

Section 14. Implied Warranty
in Sale by Description.Where
there is a contract to sell or a sale
of goods by description, there is
an implied warranty that the
goods shall correspond with the
description and if the contract or
sale be by sample, as well as by
description, it is not sufficient
that the bulk of the goods corresponds with the sample if the
goods do not also correspond
with the description.
Section 15. Implied Warranties of Quality.Subject to the
provisions of this act and of any
statute in that behalf, there is no
implied warranty or condition as
to the quality or fitness for any
particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract to sell or
a sale, except as follows:
(1) Where the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes
known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods
are required, and it appears that
the buyer relies on the sellers
skill or judgment (whether he be
the grower or manufacturer
or not), there is an implied
warranty that the goods shall be
reasonably fit for such purpose.
(2) Where the goods are
bought by description from a
seller who deals in goods of that
description (whether he be the
grower or manufacturer or not),
there is an implied warranty that
the goods shall be of merchantable quality.
(3) If the buyer has examined the goods, there is no implied warranty as regards defects
which such examination ought to
have revealed.
(4) In the case of a contract
to sell or a sale of a specified article under its patent or other
trade name, there is no implied

www.suspicions.com

warranty as to its fitness for any
particular purpose.
(5) An implied warranty or
condition as to quality or fitness
for a particular purpose may be
annexed by the usage of trade.
(6) An express warranty or
condition does not negative a
warranty or condition implied
under this act unless inconsistent therewith.
SALE BY SAMPLE
Section 16. Implied Warranties in Sale by Sample.In the
case of a contract to sell or a sale
by sample:
(a) There is an implied warranty that the bulk shall correspond with the sample in quality.
(b) There is an implied warranty that the buyer shall have a
reasonable opportunity of comparing the bulk with the sample,
except so far as otherwise provided in section 47 (3).
(c) If the seller is a dealer in
goods of that kind, there is an
implied warranty that the goods
shall be free from any defect rendering them unmerchantable
which would not be apparent on
reasonable examination of the
sample.
PART II. TRANSFER OF
PROPERTY AS BETWEEN
SELLER AND BUYER
Section 17. No Property
Passes until Goods Are Ascertained.Where there is a contract to sell unascertained goods
no property in the goods is transferred to the buyer unless and
until the goods are ascertained,
but property in an undivided
share of ascertained goods may
be transferred as provided in
Section 6.
Section 18. Property in Specific Goods Passes When Parties
so Intend.

Suspicions News Magazine

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

Section 13. Implied Warranties of Title.In a contract to sell
or a sale, unless a contrary intention appears, there is:
(1) An implied warranty on
the part of the seller that in case
of a sale he has a right to sell
the goods, and that in case of a
contract to sell he will have a
right to sell the goods at the time
when the property is to pass;
(2) An implied warranty that
the buyer shall have and enjoy
quiet possession of the goods as
against any lawful claims existing at the time of the sale;
(3) An implied warranty that
the goods shall be free at the
time of the sale from any charge
or encumbrance in favor of any
third person, not declared or
known to the buyer before or at
the time when the contract or
sale is made.
(4) This section shall not,
however, be held to render liable
a sheriff, auctioneer, mortgagee,

or other person professing to sell
by virtue of authority in fact or
law goods in which a third person has a legal or equitable interest.

115

(1) Where there is a contract
to sell specific or ascertained
goods, the property in them is
transferred to the buyer at such
time as the parties to the contract intend it to be transferred.
(2) For the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the parties, regard shall be had to the
terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties, usages of
trade and the circumstances of
the case.
Section 19. Rules for Ascertaining Intention.Unless a
different intention appears, the
following are rules for ascertaining the intention of the parties
as to the time at which the property in the goods is to pass to
the buyer.

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

RULE 1.Where there is an
unconditional contract to sell
specific goods, in a deliverable
state, the property in the goods
passes to the buyer when the
contract is made and it is immaterial whether the time of payment, or the time of delivery, or
both, be postponed.

116

RULE 2.Where there is a
contract to sell specific goods
and the seller is bound to do
something to the goods, for the
purpose of puffing them into a
deliverable state, the property
does not pass until such thing
be done.
RULE 3.
(1) When goods are delivered
to the buyer on sale or return,
or on other terms indicating an
intention to make a present sale,
but to give the buyer an option
to return the goods instead of
paying the price, the property
passes to the buyer on delivery,
but he may revest the property
in the seller by returning or tendering the goods within the time
fixed in the contract, or, if no
time has been fixed, within a reasonable time.

(2) When goods are delivered to the buyer on approval or
on trial or on satisfaction, or
other similar terms, the property
therein passes to the buyer:
(a) When he signifies his approval or acceptance to the seller
or does any other act adopting
the transaction;
(b) If he does not signify his
approval or acceptance to the
seller, but retains the goods without giving notice of rejection,
then if a time has been fixed for
the return of the goods, on the
expiration of such time, and, if
no time has been fixed, on the
expiration of a reasonable time.
What is a reasonable time is a
question of fact
RULE 4.
(1) Where there is a contract
to sell unascertained or future
goods by description, and goods
of that description and in a deliverable state are unconditionally
appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent
of the buyer, or by the buyer with
the assent of the seller, the property in the goods thereupon
passes to the buyer. Such assent
may be expressed or implied, and
may be given either before or after the appropriation is made.
(2) Where, in pursuance of a
contract to sell, the seller delivers the goods to the buyer, or to
a carrier or other bailee (whether
named by the buyer or not) for
the purpose of transmission to
or holding for the buyer, he is
presumed to have unconditionally appropriated the goods to
the contract, except in the cases
provided for in the next rule and
in section 20. This presumption
is applicable, although by the
terms of the contract the buyer
is to pay the price before receiving delivery of the goods, and the
goods are marked with the words
collect on delivery or their
equivalents.

Suspicions News Magazine

RULE 5.If the contract to

www.suspicions.info

sell requires the seller to deliver
the goods to the buyer, or at a
particular place, or to pay the
freight or cost or transportation
to the buyer, or to a particular
place, the property does not pass
until the goods have been delivered to the buyer or reached
the place agreed upon.
Section 20. Reservation of
Right of Possession or Property
When Goods are shipped.
(1) Where there is a contract
to sell specific goods, or where
goods are subsequently appropriated to the contract, the seller
may, by the terms of the contract
or appropriation, reserve the
right of possession or property
in the goods until certain conditions have been fulfilled. The
right of possession or property
may be thus reserved notwithstanding the delivery of the
goods to the buyer or to a carrier or other bailee for the purpose of transmission to the
buyer.
(2) Where
goods
are
shipped, and by the bill of lading the goods are deliverable to
the seller or his agent, or to the
order of the seller or of his agent,
the seller thereby reserves the
property in the goods. But if,
except for the form of the bill of
lading, the property would have
passed to the buyer on shipment
of the goods, the sellers property in the goods shall be
deemed to be only for the purpose of securing performance by
the buyer of his obligations under the contract.
(3) Where
goods
are
shipped, and by the bill of lading the goods are deliverable to
the order of the buyer or of his
agent, but possession of the bill
of lading is retained by the seller
or his agent, the seller thereby
reserves a right to the possession of the goods as against the
buyer.
(4) Where the seller of goods
draws on the buyer for the price

and transmits the bill of exchange and bill of lading together to the buyer to secure
acceptance or payment of the bill
of exchange, the buyer is bound
to return the bill of lading if he
does not honor the bill of exchange, and if he wrongfully retains the bill of lading he acquires no added right thereby.
If, however, the bill of lading provides that the goods are deliverable to the buyer or to the
order of the buyer, or is indorsed
in blank, or to the buyer by the
consignee named therein, one
who purchases in good faith, for
value, the bill of lading, or goods
from the buyer will obtain the
property in the goods, although
the bill of exchange has not been
honored, provided that such purchaser has received delivery of
the bill of lading indorsed by the
consignee named therein, or of
the goods, without notice of the
facts making the transfer wrongful.

Section 22. Risk of Loss
Unless otherwise agreed, the
goods remain at the sellers risk
until the property therein is
transferred to the buyer, but
when the property therein is
transferred to the buyer the
goods are at the buyers risk
whether delivery has been made
or not, except that:
(a) Where delivery of the
goods has been made to the
buyer, or to a bailee for the
buyer, in pursuance of the contract and the property in the
goods has been retained by the
seller merely to secure performance by the buyer of his obligations under the contract, the
goods are at the buyers risk
from the time of such delivery.
(b) Where delivery has been
delayed through the fault of either buyer or seller the goods are
at the risk of the party in fault as
regards any loss which might not
have occurred but for such fault.
TRANSFER OF TITLE
Section 23. Sale by a Person
Not the Owner.
(1) Subject to the provisions
of this act, where goods are sold
by a person who is not the owner
thereof, and who does not sell
them under the authority or with
the consent of the owner, the
buyer acquires no better title to
the goods than the seller had,
unless the owner of the goods is
by his conduct precluded from
denying the sellers authority to
sell.
(2) Nothing in this act, however, shall affect:

www.suspicions.com

(a) The provisions of any factors acts, recording acts, or any
enactment enabling the apparent
owner of goods to dispose of
them as if he were the true owner
thereof.
(b) The validity of any contract
to sell or sale under any special
common law or statutory power
of sale or under the order of a
court of competent jurisdiction.
Section 24. Sale by One Having a Voidable Title.Where the
seller of goods has a voidable
title thereto, but his title has not
been avoided at the time of the
sale, the buyer acquires a good
title to the goods, provided he
buys them in good faith, for
value, and without notice of the
sellers defect of title.
Section 25. Sale by Seller in
Possession of Goods Already
Sold.Where a person having
sold goods continues in possession of the goods, or of negotiable documents of title to the
goods, the delivery or transfer by
that person, or by an agent acting for him, of the goods or documents of title under any sale,
pledge, or other disposition
thereof, to any person receiving
and paying value for the same in
good faith and without notice of
the previous sale, shall have the
same effect as if the person making the delivery or transfer were
expressly authorized by the
owner of the goods to make the
same. [Compare Sales Act, Secs.
20(4), 23, and 27 through 40.]
Section 26. Creditors Rights
against Sold Goods in Sellers
Possession.Where a person
having sold goods continues in
possession of the goods, or of
negotiable documents of title to
the goods and such retention of
possession is fraudulent in fact
or is deemed fraudulent under
any rule of law, a creditor or
creditors of the seller may treat
the sale as void.

Suspicions News Magazine

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

Section 21. Sale by Auction.In the case of sale by auction:
(1) Where goods are put up
for sale by auction in lots, each
lot is the subject of a separate
contract of sale.
(2) A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer announces its completion by the
fall of the hammer, or in other
customary manner. Until such
announcement is made, any bidder may retract his bid; and the
auctioneer may withdraw the
goods from sale unless the auction has been announced to be
without reserve.
(3) A right to bid may be reserved expressly by or on behalf
of the seller.
(4) Where notice has not
been given that a sale by auction
is subject to a right to bid on
behalf of the seller, it shall not
be lawful for the seller to bid himself or to employ or induce any
person to bid at such sale on his

behalf, or for the auctioneer to
employ or induce any person to
bid at such sale on behalf of the
seller or knowingly to take any
bid from the seller or any person employed by him. Any sale
contravening this rule may be
treated as fraudulent by the
buyer.

Section 27. Definition of Negotiable Documents of Title. A
document of title in which it is
stated that the goods referred to
therein will be delivered to the
bearer, or to the order of any
person named in such document
is a negotiable document of title..

118

Section 28. Negotiation of
Negotiable Documents by Delivery.A negotiable document
of title may be negotiated by delivery:
(a) Where by the terms of the
document the carrier, warehouseman or other bailee issuing the same undertakes to deliver the goods to the bearer, or
(b) Where by the terms of the
document the carrier, warehouseman or other bailee issuing the same undertakes to deliver the goods to the order of a
specified person, and such person or a subsequent indorsee of
the document has indorsed it in
blank or to bearer.
Where by the terms of a negotiable document of title the
goods are deliverable to bearer
or where a negotiable document
of title has been indorsed in
blank or to bearer, any holder
may indorse the same to himself
or to any other specified person,
and in such case the document
shall thereafter be negotiated
only by the indorsement of such
indorsee.
Section 29. Negotiation of
Negotiable Documents by
Indorsement.A negotiable
document of title may be negotiated by the indorsement of the
person to whose order the goods
are by the terms of the document
deliverable. Such indorsement
may be in blank, to bearer or to
a specified person. If indorsed to
a specified person, it may be
again negotiated by the indorsement of such person in blank, to
bearer or to another specified
person. Subsequent negotiation
may be made in like manner.

Section 30. Negotiable Documents of Title (marked not negotiable.)If a document of title
which contains an undertaking
by a carrier, warehouseman or
other bailee to deliver the goods
to the bearer, to a specified person or order, or to the order of a
specified person, or which contains words of like import, has
placed upon it the words not
negotiable, non-negotiable or
the like, such a document may
nevertheless be negotiated by
the holder and is a negotiable
document of title within the
meaning of this act. But nothing
in this act contained shall be construed as limiting or defining the
effect upon the obligations of the
carrier, warehouseman, or other
bailee issuing a document of title
of placing thereon the words not
negotiable, nonnegotiable, or
the like.
Section 31. Transfer of Nonnegotiable Documents.A document of title which is not in such
form that it can be negotiated by
delivery may be transferred by
the holder by delivery to a purchaser or donee. A non-negotiable document can not be negotiated and the indorsement of
such a document gives the transferee no additional right.
Section 32. Who May Negotiate
a Document.A negotiable document of title may be negotiated:
(a) By the owner thereof, or
(B) By any person to whom
the possession or custody of the
document has been entrusted by
the owner, if, by the terms of the
document the bailee issuing the
document undertakes to deliver
the goods to the order of the
person to whom the possession
or custody of the document has
been entrusted, or if at the time
of such entrusting the document is in such form that it may
be negotiated by delivery.

[Under the Sales Act Amendments of 1922 the section would
read:
Section 32. [Who May Negotiate a Document.] A negotiable
document of title may be negotiated by any person in possession
of the same, however such possession may have been acquired
if, by the terms of the document,
the bailee issuing it undertakes
to deliver the goods to the order
of such person, or if at the time
of negotiation the document is
in such form that it may be negotiated by delivery.]
Section 33. Rights of Person
to Whom Document Has Been
Negotiated.A person to whom
a negotiable document of title
has been duly negotiated acquires thereby:
(a) Such title to the goods as
the person negotiating the document to him had or had ability
to convey to a purchaser in good
faith for value and also such title
to the goods as the person to
whose order the goods were to
be delivered by the terms of the
document had or had ability to
convey to a purchaser in good
faith for value, and
(B) The direct obligation of
the bailee issuing the document
to hold possession of the goods
for him according to the terms
of the document as fully as if
such bailee had contracted directly with him.
Section 34. Rights of Persons
to Whom Document Has Been
Transferred.A person to whom
a document of title has been
transferred, but not negotiated,
acquires thereby, as against the
transferor, the title to the goods,
subject to the terms of any agreement with the transferor.
If the document is non-negotiable, such person also acquires
the right to notify the bailee who
issued the document of the
transfer thereof, and thereby to

acquire the direct obligation of
such bailee to hold possession of the goods for him according to the terms of the document.
Prior to the notification of
such bailee by the transferor or
transferee of a non-negotiable
document of title, the title of the
transferee to the goods and the
right to acquire the obligation of
such bailee may be defeated by
the levy of an attachment or execution upon the goods by a
creditor of the transferor or by a
notification to such bailee by the
transferor or a subsequent purchaser from the transferor of a
subsequent sale of the goods by
the transferor.
Section 35. Transfer of Negotiable Document without Indorsement.Where a negotiable
document of title is transferred
for value by delivery, and the indorsement of the transferor is
essential for negotiation, the
transferee acquires a right
against the transferor to compel
him to indorse the document
unless a contrary intention appears. The negotiation shall take
effect as of the time when the
indorsement is actually made.

(a) That the document is
genuine;
(b) That he has a legal right
to negotiate or transfer it;
(c) That he has knowledge of
no fact which would impair the
validity or worth of the document, and
(d) That he has a right to
transfer the title to the goods
and that the goods are merchantable or fit for a particular pur-

Section 37. Indorser Not a
Guarantor.The indorsement of
a document of title shall not
make the indorser liable for any
failure on the part of the bailee who issued the document or
previous indorsers thereof to fulfill their respective obligations.
Section 38. When Negotiation Not Impaired by Fraud, Mistake or Duress.The validity of
the negotiation of a negotiable
document of title is not impaired
by the fact that the negotiation
was a breach of duty on the part
of the person making the negotiation, or by the fact that the
owner of the document was induced by fraud, mistake or duress to entrust the possession or
custody thereof to such person,
if the person to whom the document was negotiated or a person
to whom the document was subsequently negotiated paid value
therefor, without notice of the
breach of duty, or fraud, mistake
or duress.
[Under the Sales Act Amendments of 1922 the section would
read:
Section 38. [When Negotiation Not Impaired by Fraud, Mistake or Duress.] The validity of the
negotiation of a negotiable document of title is not impaired by
the fact that the negotiation was
a breach of duty on the part of
the person making the negotiation, or by the fact that the owner
of the document was deprived of
the possession of the same by
loss, theft, fraud, accident, mistake, duress, or conversion, if the
person to whom the document
was negotiated or a person to
whom the document was subse-

quently negotiated paid value
therefor in good faith without
notice of the breach of duty, or
loss, theft, fraud, accident, mistake, duress or conversion.]
Section 39. Attachment or
Levy upon Goods for Which a
Negotiable Document Has Been
Issued.If goods are delivered to
a bailee by the owner or by a
person whose act in conveying
the title to them to a purchaser
in good faith for value would
bind the owner and a negotiable
document of title is issued for
them they can not thereafter,
while in the possession of such
bailee, be attached by garnishment or otherwise or be levied
upon under an execution unless
the document be first surrendered to the bailee or its negotiation enjoined. The bailee shall
in no case be compelled to deliver up the actual possession of
the goods until the document is
surrendered to him or impounded by the court.
Section 40. Creditors Remedies to Reach Negotiable Documents.A creditor whose debtor
is the owner of a negotiable
document of title shall be entitled to such aid from courts of
appropriate jurisdiction by injunction and otherwise in attaching such document or in satisfying the claim by means thereof
as is allowed at law or in equity
in regard to property which can
not readily be attached or levied
upon by ordinary legal process.
PART III. PERFORMANCE
OF THE CONTRACT
Section 41. Seller Must Deliver and Buyer Accept Goods.
It is the duty of the seller to deliver the goods, and of the buyer
to accept and pay for them, in
accordance with the terms of the
contract to sell or sale.

Suspicions News Magazine

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

Section 36. Warranties on
sale of document.A person
who for value negotiates or
transfers a document of title by
indorsement or delivery, including one who assigns for value a
claim secured by a document of
title unless a contrary intention
appears, warrants:

pose, whenever such warranties
would have been implied if the
contract of the parties had been
to transfer without a document
of title the goods represented
thereby.

119

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

Section 42. Delivery and Payment are Concurrent Conditions.
Unless otherwise agreed,
delivery of the goods and payment
of the price are concurrent conditions; that is to say, the seller must
be ready and willing to give possession of the goods to the buyer
in exchange for the price and the
buyer must be ready and willing
to pay the price in exchange for
possession of the goods.

120

Section 43. Place, Time and
Manner of Delivery.(1) Whether
it is for the buyer to take possession of the goods or for the
seller to send them to the buyer
is a question depending in each
case on the contract, express or
implied, between the parties.
Apart from any such contract,
express or implied, or usage of
trade to the contrary, the place
of delivery is the sellers place of
business if he have one, and if
not his residence; but in the case
of a contract to sell or a sale of
specific goods, which to the
knowledge of the parties
when the contract or the sale was
made were in some other place,
then that place is the place of
delivery.
(2) Where by a contract to sell
or a sale the seller is bound to
send the goods to the buyer, but
no time for sending them is
fixed, the seller is bound to send
them within a reasonable time.
(3) Where the goods at the
time of sale are in the possession of a third person, the seller
has not fulfilled his obligation to
deliver to the buyer unless and
until such third person acknowledges to the buyer that he holds
the goods on the buyers behalf;
but as against all others than the
seller the buyer shall be regarded
as having received delivery from
the time when such third person
first has notice of the sale. Nothing in this section, however, shall
affect the operation of the issue
or transfer of any document of
title to goods.

(4) Demand or tender of delivery may be treated as ineffectual unless made at a reasonable
hour. What is a reasonable hour
is a question of fact.
(5) Unless otherwise agreed,
the expenses of and incidental
to putting the goods into a deliverable state must be borne by
the seller.
Section Delivery of Wrong
Quantity.(1) Where the seller
delivers to the buyer a quantity
of goods less than he contracted
to sell, the buyer may reject
them, but if the buyer accepts or
retains the goods so delivered,
knowing that the seller is not
going to perform the contract in
full, he must pay for them at the
contract rate. If, however, the
buyer has used or disposed of
the goods delivered before he
knows that the seller is not going to perform his contract in full,
the buyer shall not be liable for
more than the fair value to him
of the goods so received.
(2) Where the seller delivers
to the buyer a quantity of goods
larger than he contracted to sell,
the buyer may accept the goods
included in the contract and reject the rest, or he may reject the
whole. If the buyer accepts
the whole of the goods so delivered he must pay for them at the
contract rate.
(3) Where the seller delivers
to the buyer the goods he contracted to sell mixed with goods
of a different description not included in the contract, the buyer
may accept the goods which are
in accordance with the contract
and reject the rest, or he may
reject the whole.
(4) The provisions of this section are subject to any usage-of
trade, special agreement, or
course of dealing between the
parties.
Section 45. Delivery in Installments.(1) Unless otherwise
agreed, the buyer of goods is not

bound to accept delivery thereof
by installments.
(2) Where there is a contract
to sell goods to be delivered by
stated installments, which are to
be separately paid for, and the
seller makes defective deliveries
in respect of one or more installments, or the buyer neglects
or refuses to take delivery of or
pay for one or more installments,
it depends in each case on the
terms of the contract and the circumstances of the case, whether
the breach of contract is so material as to justify the injured
party in refusing to proceed further and suing for damages for
breach of the entire contract, or
whether the breach is severable,
giving rise to a claim for compensation, but not to a right to treat
the whole contract as broken.
Section 46. Delivery to a Carrier on Behalf of the Buyer. (1)
Where, in pursuance of a contract
to sell or a sale, the seller is authorized or required to send the
goods to the buyer, delivery of
the goods to a carrier, whether
named by the buyer or not, for
the purpose of transmission to
the buyer is deemed to be a delivery of the goods to the buyer,
except in the cases provided for
in section 19, Rule 5, or unless a
contrary intent appears.
(2) Unless otherwise authorized by the buyer, the seller
must make such contract with
the carrier on behalf of the buyer
as may be reasonable, having
regard to the nature of the goods
and the other circumstances of
the case. If the seller omit so to
do,
and the goods are lost or
damaged in course of transit, the
buyer may decline to treat the
delivery to the carrier as a delivery to himself, or may hold the
seller responsible in damages.
(3) Unless otherwise agreed,
where goods are sent by the
seller to the buyer under circumstances in which the seller knows

or ought to know that it is usual
to insure, the seller must give
such notice to the buyer as may
enable him to insure them during their transit, and, if the seller
fails to do so, the goods shall be
deemed to be at his risk during
such transit.

Section 48. What Constitutes
Acceptance.The buyer is
deemed to have accepted the
goods when he intimates to the
seller that he has accepted them,
or when the goods have been
delivered to him, and he does any
act in relation to them which is
inconsistent with the ownership
of the seller, or when, after the
lapse of a reasonable time, he
retains the goods without inti-

Section 50. Buyer Is Not
Bound to Return Goods Wrongly
Delivered.Unless otherwise
agreed, where the goods are delivered to the buyer, and he refuses to accept them, having the
right to do so, he is not bound
to return them, to the seller, but
it is sufficient if he notifies the
seller that he refused to accept
them.
Section 51. Buyers Liability
for Failing to Accept Delivery.
When the seller is ready and willing to deliver the goods, and requests the buyer to take delivery, and the buyer does not
within a reasonable time after
such request take delivery of the
goods, he is liable to the seller
for any loss occasioned by his
neglect or refusal to take delivery, and also for a reasonable
charge for the care and custody
of the goods. If the neglect or
refusal of the buyer to take delivery amounts to a repudiation
or breach of the entire contract,
the seller shall have the rights
against the goods and on the
contract hereinafter provided in
favor of the seller when the buyer
is in default.

mating to the seller that he has
rejected them.
Section 49. Acceptance Does
Not Bar Action for Damages.
In the absence of express
or implied agreement of the parties, acceptance of the goods by
the buyer shall not discharge the
seller from liability in damages
or other legal remedy for breach
of any promise or warranty in the
contract to sell or the sale. But,
if, after acceptance of the goods,
the buyer fail to give notice to
the seller of the breach of any
promise or warranty within a reasonable time after the buyer
knows, or ought to know of such
breach, the seller shall not be liable therefor.

Section 56. When Lien Is

act, when the buyer of goods is
or becomes insolvent, the unpaid
seller who has parted with the
possession of the goods has
the right of stopping them in
transitu, that is to say, he may
resume possession of the goods
at any time while they are in transit, and he will then become entitled to the same rights in regard to the goods as he would

the buyer or his agent; and it is
immaterial that a further destination for the goods may have
been indicated by the buyer;

the goods to the buyer or his
agent in that behalf.
(3) If the goods are delivered

possession of the master as a
carrier or as agent of the buyer.
(4) If part delivery of the
goods has been made to the
buyer, or his agent in that behalf,

Section Ways of Exercising
the Right to Stop.
(1) The unpaid seller may
exercise his right of stoppage in
transitu either by obtaining actual possession of the goods or
by giving notice of his claim to
the carrier or other bailee in
whose possession the goods are.
Such notice may be given either
to the person in actual possession of the goods or to his principal. In the latter case the notice, to be effectual, must be
given at such time and under
such circumstances that the principal, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, may prevent a
delivery to the buyer.
(2) When notice of stoppage
in transitu is given by the seller
to the carrier, or other bailee in
possession of the goods, he
must redeliver the goods to, or
according to the directions of,
the seller. The expenses of such
delivery must be borne by the
seller. If, however, a negotiable
document of title representing
the goods has been issued by the

carrier or other bailee, he shall
not be obliged to deliver or justified in delivering the goods to
the seller unless such document
is first surrendered for cancellation.
RESALE BY THE SELLER

RESCISSION BY THE SELLER
Section 61. When and How
the Seller May Rescind the Sale.
(1) An unpaid seller having a
right of lien or having stopped
the goods in transitu, may rescind the transfer of title and
resume the property in the
goods, where he expressly reserved the right to do so in case
the buyer should make default,
or where the buyer has been in
default in the payment of the
price an unreasonable time. The
seller shall not thereafter be liable to the buyer upon the contract to sell or the sale, but may
recover from the buyer damages
for any loss occasioned by the
breach of the contract or the sale.
(2) The transfer of title shall
not be held to have been rescinded by an unpaid seller until
he has manifested by notice to
the buyer or by some other overt
act an intention to rescind. It is
not necessary that such overt act
should be communicated to the
buyer, but the giving or failure
to give notice to the buyer of the
intention to rescind shall be relevant in any issue involving the
question whether the buyer had
been in default an unreasonable
time before the right of rescission was asserted.
Section 62. Effect of Sale of
Goods Subject to Lien or Stoppage in TransituSubject to the
provisions of this act, the unpaid
sellers right of lien or stoppage
in transitu is not affected by any
sale, or other disposition of the
goods which the buyer may have
made, unless the seller has assented thereto.
If, however, a negotiable
document of title has been issued for goods, no sellers lien
or right or stoppage in transitu

www.suspicions.com

shall defeat the right of any purchaser for value in good faith to
whom such document has been
negotiated, whether such negotiation be prior or subsequent to
the notification to the carrier, or
other bailee who issued such
document, of the sellers claim
to a lien or right of stoppage in
transitu.
PART V. ACTIONS FOR
BREACH OF THE CONTRACT
REMEDIES OF THE SELLER
Section 63. Action for the
Price.
( 1) Where, under a contract
to sell or a sale, the property in
the goods has passed to the
buyer, and the buyer wrongfully
neglects or refuses to pay for the
goods according to the terms of
the contract or the sale, the seller
may maintain an action against
him for the price of the goods.
(2) Where, under a contract
to sell or a sale, the price is payable on a day certain, irrespective of delivery or of transfer of
title, and the buyer wrongfully
neglects or refuses to pay such
price, the seller may maintain an
action for the price, although the
property in the goods has not
passed, and the goods have not
been appropriated to the contract. But it shall be a defense to
such an action that the seller at
any time before the judgment in
such action has manifested an
inability to perform the contract
or the sale on his part or an intention not to perform it.
(3) Although the property in
the goods has not passed, if they
can not readily be resold for a
reasonable price, and if the provisions of section 64 (4) are not
applicable, the seller may offer
to deliver the goods to the buyer,
and, if the buyer refuses to receive them, may notify the buyer
that the goods are thereafter
held by the seller as bailee for

Suspicions News Magazine

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

Section 60. When and How
Resale May Be Made.
(1) Where the goods are of a
perishable nature, or where the
seller expressly reserves the
right of resale in case the buyer
should make default, or where
the buyer has been in default in
the payment of the price an unreasonable time, an unpaid seller
having a right of lien or having
stopped the goods in transitu
may resell the goods. He shall
not thereafter be liable to the
original buyer upon the contract
to sell or the sale or for any profit
made by such resale, but may
recover from the buyer damages
for any loss occasioned by the
breach of the contract or the sale.
(2) Where a resale is made,
as authorized in this section, the
buyer acquires a good title as
against the original buyer.
(3) It is not essential to the
validity of a resale that notice of
an intention to resell the goods
be given by the seller to the original buyer. But where the right to
resell is not based on the perishable nature of the goods or upon
an express provision of the contract or the sale, the giving or
failure to give such notice shall
be relevant in any issue involving the question whether the
buyer had been in default an
unreasonable time before the
resale was made.
(4) It is not essential to the
validity of a resale that notice of
the time and place of such resale
should be given by the seller to
the original buyer.
(5) The seller is bound to
exercise reasonable care and
judgment in making a resale, and

subject to this requirement may
make a resale either by public or
private sale.

123

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

the buyer. Thereafter the seller
may treat the goods as the
buyers and may maintain an action for the price.

124

Section 64. Action for Damages for Non-acceptance of the
Goods.
(1) Where the buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to accept
and pay for the goods, the seller
may maintain an action against
him for damages for non-acceptance.
(2) The measure of damages
is the estimated loss directly and
naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the
buyers breach of contract.
(3) Where there is an available market for the goods in
question, the measure of damages is, in the absence of special circumstances, showing
proximate damage of a greater
amount, the difference between
the contract price and the market or current price at the time
or times when the goods ought
to have been accepted, or, if no
time was fixed for acceptance,
then at the time of the refusal to
accept.
(4) If, while labor or expense
of material amount are necessary
on the part of the seller to enable
him to fulfill his obligations under the contract to sell or the sale,
the buyer repudiates the contract
or the sale, or notifies the seller
to proceed no further therewith,
the buyer shall be liable to the
seller for no greater damages
than the seller would have suffered if he did nothing towards
carrying out the contract or the
sale after receiving notice of the
buyers repudiation or countermand. The profit the seller would
have made if the contract or the
sale had been fully performed
shall be considered in estimating
such damages.
Section 65. When Seller May
Rescind Contract or Sale.
Where the goods have not been

delivered to the buyer, and the
buyer has repudiated the contract to sell or sale, or has manifested his inability to perform his
obligations thereunder, or has
committed a material breach
thereof, the seller may totally
rescind the contract or the sale
by giving notice of his election
so to do to the buyer.
REMEDIES OF THE BUYER
Section 66. Action for Converting or Detaining Goods.
Where the property in the goods
has passed to the buyer and the
seller wrongfully neglects or refuses to deliver the goods, the
buyer may maintain any action
allowed by law to the owner of
goods of similar kind when
wrongfully converted or withheld.
Section 67. Action for Failing
to Deliver Goods.
(1) Where the property in the
goods has not passed to the
buyer, and the seller wrongfully
neglects or refuses to deliver the
goods, the buyer may maintain
an action against the seller for
damages for non-delivery.
(2) The measure of damages
is the loss directly and naturally
resulting in the ordinary course
of events, from the sellers
breach of contract.
(3) Where there is an available market for the goods in
question, the measure of damages, in the absence of special
circumstances showing proximate damages of a greater
amount, is the difference between the contract price and the
market or current price of the
goods at the time or times when
they ought to have been delivered, or, if no time was fixed,
then at the time of the refusal to
deliver.
Section 68. Specific Performance.Where the seller has

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

broken a contract to deliver specific or ascertained goods, a
court having the powers of a
court of equity may, if it thinks
fit, on the application of the
buyer, by its judgment or decree
direct that the contract shall be
performed specifically, without
giving the seller the option of
retaining the goods on payment
of damages. The judgment or
decree may be unconditional, or
upon such terms and conditions
as to damages, payment of the
price and otherwise, as to the
court may seem just.
Section 69. Remedies for
Breach of Warranty.
(1) Where there is a breach
of warranty by the seller, the
buyer may, at his election:
(a) Accept or keep the goods
and set up against the seller, the
breach of warranty by way of recoupment in diminution or extinction of the price;
(b) Accept or keep the goods
and maintain an action against
the seller for damages for the
breach of warranty;
(c) Refuse to accept the
goods, if the property therein has
not passed, and maintain an action against the seller for damages for the breach of warranty;
(d) Rescind the contract to
sell or the sale and refuse to receive the goods, or if the goods
have already been received, return them or offer to return them
to the seller and recover the price
or any part thereof which has
been paid.
(2) When the buyer has
claimed and been granted a remedy in any one of these ways, no
other remedy can thereafter be
granted.
(3) Where the goods have
been delivered to the buyer he
can not rescind the sale if he
knew of the breach of warranty
when he accepted the goods, or
if he fails to notify the seller
within a reasonable time of the
election to rescind, or if he fails
to return or to offer to return the

Section 70. Interest and Special Damages.Nothing in this

act shall affect the right of the
buyer or the seller to recover interest or special damages in any
case where by law interest or
special damages may be recoverable, or to recover money paid
where the consideration for the
payment of it has failed.
PART VI. INTERPRETATION
Section 71. Variation of Implied Obligations.Where any
right, duty or liability would arise
under a contract to sell or a sale
of implication of law, it may be
negatived or varied by express
agreement or by the course of
dealing between the parties, or
by custom, if the custom be such
as to bind both parties to the

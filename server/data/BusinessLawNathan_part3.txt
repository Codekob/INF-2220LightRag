t affected by a
provision which
(1) Authorizes the sale of
collateral securities in case the
instrument be not paid at maturity; or
(2) Authorizes a confession
of judgment if the instrument be
not paid at maturity; or
(3) Waives the benefit of any
law intended for the advantage
or protection of the obligor; or
(4) Gives the holder an election to require something to be
done in lieu of payment of
money.
But nothing in this section
shall validate any provision or
stipulation otherwise illegal.
Section 6.The validity and
negotiable character of an instrument are not affected by the fact
that
(1) It is not dated; or
(2) Does not specify the

a sum certain in money;
(3) Must be payable on demand, or at a fixed or determinable future time;
(4) Must be payable to order
or to bearer; and,
(5) Where the instrument is
addressed to a drawee, he must
be named or otherwise indicated
therein with reasonable certainty.
Section 2. - The sum payable
is a sum certain within the meaning of this act, although it is to
be paid
(1) With interest; or
(2) By stated installments; or
(3) By stated installments,
with a provision that upon default in payment of any installment or of interest the whole

shall become due; or
(4) With exchange, whether
at a fixed rate or at the current
rate; or
(5) With costs of collection
or an attorneys fee, in case payment shall not be made at maturity.
Section 3.An unqualified
order or promise to pay is
unconditional within the meaning of this act, though coupled
with
(1) An indication of a particular fund out of which
reimbursement is to be made, or
a particular account to be debited with the amount; or
(2) A statement of the transaction which gives rise to the instrument.
But an order or promise to
pay out of a particular fund is not
unconditional.
Section 4.An instrument is
payable at a determinable future
time, within the meaning of this
act, which is expressed to be
payable
(1) At a fixed period after
date or sight; or
(2) On or before a fixed or
determinable future time specified therein; or
(3) On or at a fixed period
after the occurrence of a special
event, which is certain to happen,

value given, or that any value has
been given therefor; or
(3) Does not specify the
place where it is drawn or the
place where it is payable; or
(4) Bears a seal; or
(5) Designates a particular
kind of current money in which
payment is to be made.
But nothing in this section
shall alter or repeal any statute
requiring in certain cases the
nature of the consideration to be
stated in the instrument.
Section 7.An instrument is
payable on demand:
(1) Where it is expressed to
be payable on demand, or at
sight, or on presentation; or
(2) In which no time for payment is expressed.
Where an instrument is issued, accepted, or indorsed
when overdue, it is, as regards
the person so issuing, accepting,
or indorsing it, payable on demand.
Section 8.The instrument
is payable to order where it is
drawn payable to the order of a
specified person or to him or his
order. It may be drawn payable
to the order of
(1) A payee who is not
maker, drawer, or drawee; or
(2) The drawer or maker; or
(3) The drawee; or
(4) Two or more payees
jointly; or
(5) One or some of several
payees; or
(6) The holder of an office for
the time being.
Where the instrument is payable to order the payee must be
named or otherwise indicated
therein with reasonable certainty.
Section 9.The instrument is
payable to bearer
(1) When it is expressed to
be so payable; or
(2) When it is payable to a
person named therein or bearer;
or
(3) When it is payable to the
order of a fictitious or non-exist-

ing person, and such fact was
known to the person making it
so payable; or
(4) When the name of the
payee does not purport to be the
name of any person; or
(5) When the only or last indorsement is an indorsement in
blank.
Section 10.The instrument
need not follow the language of
this act, but any terms are sufficient which clearly indicate an intention to conform to the requirements hereof.
Section 11.Where the instrument or an acceptance or any
indorsement thereon is dated,
such date is deemed prima facie
to be the true date of the making, drawing, acceptance, or
indorsement as the case may be.
Section 12.The instrument
is not invalid for the reason only
that it is ante-dated or postdated, provided this is not done
for an illegal or fraudulent purpose. The person to whom an instrument so dated is delivered
acquires the title thereto as of
the date of delivery.
Section 13.Where an instrument expressed to be payable at a fixed period after date
is issued undated, or where the
acceptance of an instrument payable at a fixed period after sight
is undated, any holder may insert therein the true date of issue or acceptance, and the instrument shall be payable accordingly. The insertion of a
wrong date does not avoid the
instrument in the hands of a subsequent holder in due course;
but as to him, the date so inserted is to be regarded as the
true date.
Section 14.Where the instrument is wanting in any material particular, the person in
possession thereof has a prima
facie authority to complete it by
filling up the blanks therein. And
a signature on a blank paper
delivered by the person making
the signature in order that the

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

paper may be converted into a
negotiable instrument operates
as a prima facie authority to fill
it up as such for any amount. In
order, however, that any such
instrument when completed may
be enforced against any person
who became a party thereto prior
to its completion, it must be filled
up strictly in accordance with the
authority given and within a reasonable time. But if any such instrument, after completion, is
negotiated to a holder in due
course, it is valid and effectual
for all purposes in his hands, and
he may enforce it as if it had been
filled up strictly in accordance
with the authority given and
within a reasonable time.
Section 15.Where an incomplete instrument has not
been delivered it will not, if completed and negotiated, without
authority, be a valid contract in
the hands of any holder, as
against any person whose signature was placed thereon before
delivery.
Section 16.Every contract
on a negotiable instrument is incomplete and revocable until
delivery of the instrument for the
purpose of giving effect thereto.
As between immediate parties,
and as regards a remote party
other than a holder in due
course, the delivery, in order to
be effectual, must be made either
by or under the authority of the
party making, drawing, accepting, or indorsing, as the case may
be; and in such case the delivery
may be shown to have been conditional, or for a special purpose
only, and not for the purpose of
transferring the property in the
instrument. But where the instrument is in the hands of a holder
in due course, a valid delivery
thereof by all parties prior to him
so as to make them liable to him
is conclusively presumed. And
where the instrument is no
longer in the possession of a
party whose signature appears
thereon, a valid and intentional

Section 19.The signature
of any party may be made by a
duly authorized agent. No particular form of appointment is
necessary for this purpose; and
the authority of the agent may
be established as in other cases
of agency.
Section 20.Where the instrument contains or a person
adds to his signature words indicating that he signs for or on
behalf of a principal, or in a representative capacity, he is not liable on the instrument if he was
duly authorized; but the mere
addition of words describing him
as an agent, or as filling a representative character, without disclosing his principal, does not
exempt him from personal liability.
Section 21.A signature by
procuration operates as notice
that the agent has but a limited
authority to sign,, and the principal is bound only in case the
agent in so signing acted within
the actual limits of his authority.
Section 22.The indorsement or assignment of the instrument by a corporation or by
an infant passes the property
therein, notwithstanding that
from want of capacity the corporation or infant may incur no liability thereon.
Section 23.When a signature is forged or made without
the authority of the person
whose signature it purports to
be, it is wholly inoperative, and
no right to retain the instrument,
or to give a discharge therefor,
or to enforce payment thereof
against any party thereto, can be
acquired through or under such
signature, unless the party,
against whom it is sought to enforce such right, is precluded
from setting up the forgery or
want of authority.
ARTICLE II.CONSIDERATION
Section 24.Every negotiable instrument is deemed
prima facie to have been issued

www.suspicions.com

for a valuable consideration; and
every-person whose signature
appears thereon to have become
a party thereto for value.
Section 25.Value is any
consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. An antecedent or pre-existing debt constitutes value; and is deemed
such whether the instrument is
payable on demand or at a future time.
Section 26.Where value has
at any time been given for the
instrument, the holder is deemed
a holder for value in respect to
all parties who became such prior
to that time.
Section 27.Where the
holder has a lien on the, instrument, arising either from contract or by implication of law, he
is deemed a holder for value to
the extent of his lien.
Section 28.Absence or failure of consideration is matter of
defense as against any person
not a holder in due course; and
partial failure of consideration is
a defense pro tanto, whether the
failure is an ascertained and liquidated amount or otherwise.
Section 29.An accommodation party is one who has signed
the instrument as maker, drawer,
acceptor, or indorser, without
receiving value therefor, and for
the purpose of lending his name
to some other person. Such a
person is liable on the instrument to a holder for value, notwithstanding such holder at the
time of taking the instrument
knew him to be only an accommodation party.
ARTICLE III.NEGOTIATION
Section 30.An instrument
is negotiated when it is transferred from one person to another in such manner as to constitute the transferee the holder
thereof. If payable to bearer it is
negotiated by delivery; if payable
to order it is negotiated by the
indorsement of the holder completed by delivery.

Suspicions News Magazine

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

delivery by him is presumed until the contrary is proved.
Section 17.Where the language of the instrument is
ambiguous or there are omissions therein, the following rules
of construction apply:
(1) Where the sum payable is
expressed in words and also in
figures and there is a discrepancy between the two, the sum
denoted by the words is the sum
payable; but if the words are ambiguous or uncertain, reference
may be had to the figures to fix
the amount;
(2) Where the instrument
provides for the payment of interest, without specifying the
date from which interest is to
run, the interest runs from the
date of the instrument, and if the
instrument is undated, from the
issue thereof;
(3) Where the instrument is
not dated, it will be considered
to be dated as of the time it was
issued;
(4) Where there is a conflict
between the written and printed
provisions of the instrument, the
written provisions prevail;
(5) Where the instrument is
so ambiguous that there is doubt
whether it is a bill or note, the
holder may treat it as either at
his election;
(6) Where a signature is so
placed upon the instrument that
it is not clear in what capacity the
person making the same intended to sign, he is to be
deemed an indorser;
(7) Where an instrument containing the words, I promise to
pay, is signed by two or more
persons, they are deemed to be
jointly and severally liable thereon.
Section 18.No person is liable on the instrument whose
signature does not appear
thereon, except as herein otherwise expressly provided. But one
who signs in a trade or assumed
name will be liable to the same
extent as if he had signed in his
own name.

Section 31.The indorsement must be written on the
instrument itself or upon a paper attached thereto. The signature of
the indorser, without additional words, is a sufficient
indorsement.
Section 32.The indorsement must be an indorsement of
the entire instrument. An indorsement, which purports to
transfer to the indorsee a part
only of the amount payable, or
which purports to transfer the
instrument to two or more
indorsees severally, does not
operate as a negotiation of the
instrument. But where the instrument has been paid in part, it
may be indorsed as to the residue.
Section 33.An indorsement
may be either special or in blank;
and it may also be either restrictive or qualified, or conditional.
Section 34.A special indorsement specifies the person
to whom, or to whose order, the
instrument is to be payable; and
the indorsement of such indorsee is necessary to the further
negotiation of the instrument.
An indorsement in blank specifies no indorsee, and an instrument so indorsed is payable to
bearer, and may be negotiated
by delivery.
Section 35.The holder may
convert a blank indorsement into
a special indorsement by writing
over the signature of the indorser in blank any contract consistent with the character of the
indorsement.
Section 36.An indorsement
is restrictive, which either
(1) Prohibits the further negotiation of the instrument; or
(2) Constitutes the indorsee
the agent of the indorser; or
(3) Vests the title in the indorsee in trust for or to the use
of some other person.
But the mere absence of
words implying power to negotiate does not make an indorse-

ment restrictive.
Section 37.A restrictive indorsement confers upon the indorsee the right
(1) To receive payment of
the instrument;
(2) To bring any action
thereon that the indorser could
bring;
(3) To transfer his rights as
such indorsee, where the form of
the indorsement authorizes him
to do so.
But all subsequent indorsees
acquire only the title of the first
indorsee under the restrictive
indorsement.
Section 38.A qualified indorsement constitutes the indorser a mere assignor of the
title to the instrument. It may be
made by adding to the indorsers
signature the words without recourse, or any words of similar
import. Such an indorsement
does not impair the negotiable
character of the instrument.
Section 39.Where an indorsement is conditional, a party
required to pay the instrument
may disregard the condition, and
make payment to the indorsee or
his transferee, whether the condition has been fulfilled or not.
But any person to whom an instrument so indorsed is negotiated, will hold the same, or the
proceeds thereof, subject to the
rights of the person indorsing
conditionally.
Section 40.Where an instrument, payable to bearer, is
indorsed specially, it may nevertheless be further negotiated by
delivery; but the person indorsing specially is liable as indorser
to only such holders as make title
through his indorsement.
Section 41.Where an instrument is payable to the order
of two or more payees or
indorsees who are not partners,
all must indorse, unless the one
indorsing has authority to indorse for the others.
Section 42.Where an instrument is drawn or indorsed to

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

a person as Cashier or other fiscal officer of a bank or corporation, it is deemed prima facie to
be payable to the bank or corporation of which he is such officer, and may be negotiated by
either the indorsement of the
bank or corporation, or the
indorsement of the officer.
Section 43.Where the name
of a payee or indorsee is wrongly
designated or misspelled, he
may indorse the instrument as
therein described, adding, if he
think fit, his proper signature.
Section 44.Where any person is under obligation to indorse in a representative capacity, he may indorse in such terms
as to negative personal liability.
Section 45.Except where
an indorsement bears date after
the maturity of the instrument,
every negotiation is deemed
prima facie to have been effected
before the instrument was overdue.
Section 46.Except where
the contrary appear; every
indorsement is presumed prima
facie to have been made at the
place where the instrument is
dated.
Section 47.An instrument
negotiable in its origin continues
to be negotiable until it has been
restrictively indorsed or discharged by payment or otherwise.
Section 48.The holder may
at any time strike out any indorsement which is not necessary to his title. The indorser
whose indorsement is struck out,
and all indorsers subsequent to
him, are thereby relieved from
liability on the instrument.
Section 49.Where the
holder of an instrument payable
to his order transfers it for value
without indorsing it, the transfer vests in the transferee such
title as the transferor had
therein, and the transferee acquires, in addition, the right to
have the indorsement of the
transferor. But for the purpose

of determining whether the
transferee is a holder in due
course, the negotiation takes effect as of the time when the indorsement is actually made.
Section 50.Where an instrument is negotiated back to a
prior. party, such party may, subject to the provisions of this act,
reissue and further negotiate the
same. But he is not entitled to
enforce payment thereof against
any intervening party to whom
he was personally liable.

prior to the acquisition of such
defective title.
ARTICLE V.
LIABILITIES OF PARTIES
Section 60.The maker of a
negotiable instrument by making
it engages that he will pay it according to its tenor, and admits
the existence of the payee and
his then capacity to indorse.
Section 61.The drawer by
drawing the instrument admits
the existence of the payee and
his then capacity to indorse; and
engages that on due presentment the instrument will be accepted or paid, or both, according to its tenor, and that if it be
dishonored, and the necessary
proceedings on dishonor be duly
taken, he will pay the amount
thereof to the holder, or to any
subsequent indorser who may be
compelled to pay it. But the
drawer may insert in the instrument an express stipulation
negativing or limiting his own liability to the holder.
Section 62.The acceptor by
accepting the instrument engages that he will pay it according to the tenor of his acceptance; and admits
(1) The existence of the
drawer, the genuineness of his
signature, and his capacity and
authority to draw the instrument;
and
(2) The existence of the
payee and his then capacity to
indorse.
Section 63.A person placing his signature upon an instrument otherwise than as maker,
drawer or acceptor, is deemed to
be an indorser, unless he clearly
indicates by appropriate words
his intention to be bound in
some other capacity.
Section 64.Where a person,
not otherwise a party to an instrument, places thereon his signature in blank before delivery,
he is liable as indorser, in accordance with the following rules:
(1) If the instrument is pay-

ARTICLE IV.
RIGHTS OF THE HOLDER
Section 51.The holder of a
negotiable instrument may sue
thereon in his own name; and
payment to him in due course
discharges the instrument.
Section 52.A holder in due
course is a holder who has taken
the instrument under the following conditions:
(1) That it is complete and
regular upon its face;
(2) That he became the
holder of it before it was overdue, and without notice that it
had been previously dishonored,
if such was the fact;
(3) That he took it in good
faith and for value;
(4) That at the time it was
negotiated to him he had no notice of any infirmity in the instrument or defect in the title of the
person negotiating it.
Section 53.Where an instrument payable on demand is
negotiated an unreasonable
length of time after its issue, the
holder is not deemed a holder in
due course.
Section 54.Where the
transferee receives notice of any
infirmity in the instrument or
defect in the title of the person
negotiating the same before he
has paid the full amount agreed
to be paid therefor, he will be
deemed a holder in due course
only to the extent of the amount
theretofore paid by him.
Section 55.The title of a

person who negotiates an instrument is defective within the
meaning of this act when he obtained the instrument, or any signature thereto, by fraud, duress,
or force and fear, or other unlawful means, or for an illegal consideration, or when he negotiates
it in breach of faith, or under
such circumstances as amount to
a fraud.
Section 56.To constitute
notice of an infirmity in the
instrument or defect in the title
of the person negotiating the
same, the person to whom it is
negotiated must have had actual
knowledge of the infirmity or
defect, or knowledge of such
facts that his action in taking the
instrument amounted to bad
faith.
Section 57.A holder in due
course holds the instrument free
from any defect of title of prior
parties, and free from defenses
available to prior parties among
themselves, and may enforce
payment of the instrument for
the full amount thereto against
all parties liable thereon.
Section 58.In the hands of
any holder other than a holder
in due course, a negotiable instrument is subject to the same
defenses as if it were non-negotiable. But a holder who derives
his title through a holder in due
course, and who is not himself a
party to any fraud or illegality affecting the instrument, has all
the rights of such former holder
in respect of all parties prior to
the latter.
Section 59.Every holder is
deemed prima facie to be a
holder in due course; but when
it is shown that the title of any
person who has negotiated the
instrument was defective, the
burden is on the holder to prove
that he or some person under
whom he claims acquired the
title as holder in due course. But
the last-mentioned rule does not
apply in favor of a party who became bound on the instrument

able to the order of a third person, he is liable to the payee and
to all subsequent parties.
(2) If the instrument is payable to the order of the maker or
drawer, or is payable to bearer,
he is liable to all parties subsequent to the maker or drawer.
(3) If he signs for the accommodation of the payee, he is liable to all parties subsequent to
the payee.
Section 65.Every person
negotiating an instrument by delivery or by a qualified indorsement, warrants
(1) That the instrument is
genuine and in all respects what
it purports to be;
(2) That he has a good title
to it;
(3) That all prior parties had
capacity to contract;
(4) That he has no knowledge of any fact which would
impair the validity of the instrument or render it valueless.
But when the negotiation is
by delivery only, the warranty extends in favor of no holder other
than the immediate transferee.
The provisions of subdivision
three of this section do not apply to persons negotiating public or corporation securities,
other than bills and notes.
Section 66.Every indorser
who indorses without qualification, warrants to all subsequent
holders in due course:
(1) The matters and things
mentioned in subdivisions one,
two, and three of the next preceding section; and
(2) That the instrument is at
the time of his indorsement valid
and subsisting.
And, in addition, he engages
that on due presentment, it shall
be accepted or paid, or both, as
the case may be, according to its
tenor, and that if it be dishonored, and the necessary proceedings on dishonor be duly taken,
he will pay the amount thereof
to the holder, or to any subsequent indorser who may be com-

pelled to pay it.
Section 67.Where a person
places his indorsement on an instrument negotiable by delivery
he incurs all the liabilities of an
indorser.
Section 68.As respects one
another, indorsers are liable
prima facie in the order in which
they indorse; but evidence is admissible to show that as between
or among themselves they have
agreed otherwise. Joint payees or
joint indorsees who indorse are
deemed to indorse jointly and
severally.
Section 69.Where a broker
or other agent negotiates an instrument without indorsement,
he incurs all the liabilities prescribed by section sixty-five of
this act, unless he discloses the
name of his principal, and the
fact that he is acting only as
agent.
ARTICLE VI. PRESENTMENT
FOR PAYMENT
Section 70.Presentment for
payment is not necessary in order to charge the person primarily liable on the instrument; but
if the instrument is, by its terms,
payable at a special place, and
he is able and willing to pay it
there at maturity, such ability
and willingness are equivalent to
a tender of payment upon his
part. But except as herein otherwise provided, presentment for
payment is necessary in order to
charge the drawer and indorsers.
Section 71.Where the instrument is not payable on demand, presentment must he
made on the day it falls due.
Where it is payable on demand,
presentment must be made
within a reasonable time after its
issue, except that in the case of
a bill of exchange, presentment
for payment will be sufficient if
made within a reasonable time
after the last negotiation thereof.
Section 72.Presentment for
payment, to be sufficient, must
be made

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

(1) By the holder, or by some
person authorized to receive payment on his behalf;
(2) At a reasonable hour on
a business day;
(3) At a proper place as
herein defined;
(4) To the person primarily
liable on the instrument, or if he
is absent or inaccessible, to any
person found at the place where
the presentment is made.
Section 73.Presentment for
payment is made at the proper
place
(1) Where a place of payment
is specified in the instrument and
it is there presented;
(2) Where no place of payment is specified, but the address of the person to make payment is given in the instrument
and it is there presented;
(3) Where no place of payment is specified and no address
is given and the instrument is
presented at the usual place of
business or residence of the person to make payment;
(4) In any other case if presented to the person to make
payment wherever he can be
found, or if presented at his last
known place of business or residence.
Section 74.The instrument
must be exhibited to the person
from whom payment is demanded, and when it is paid
must be delivered up to the party
paying it.
Section 75.Where the instrument is payable at a bank,
presentment for payment must
be made during banking hours,
unless the person to make payment has no funds there to meet
it at any time during the day, in
which case presentment at any
hour before the bank is closed
on that day is sufficient.
Section 76.Where the person primarily liable on the instrument is dead, and no place of
payment is specified, presentment for payment must be made
to his personal representative if

(2) Presentment is excused
and the instrument is overdue
and unpaid.
Section 84.Subject to the
provisions of this act, when the
instrument is dishonored by nonpayment, an immediate right of
recourse to all parties secondarily liable thereon accrues to the
holder.
Section 85.Every negotiable instrument is payable at
the time fixed therein without
grace. When the day of maturity
falls upon Sunday, or a holiday,
the instrument is payable on the
next succeeding business day.
Instruments falling due on Saturday are to be presented for
payment on the next succeeding
business day, except that instruments payable on demand may,
at the option of the holder, be
presented for payment before
twelve oclock noon on Saturday
when that entire day is not a holiday.
Section 86.Where the instrument is payable at a fixed
period after date, after sight, or
after the happening of a specified event, the time of payment
is determined by excluding the
day from which the time is to
begin to run, and by including
the date of payment.
Section 87.Where the instrument is made payable at a
bank it is equivalent to an order
to the bank to pay the same for
the account of the principal
debtor thereon.
Section 88.Payment is
made in due course when it is
made at or after the maturity of
the instrument to the holder
thereof in good faith and without notice that his title is defective.
ARTICLE VII.
NOTICE OF DISHONOR
Section 89.Except as
herein otherwise provided, when
a negotiable instrument has
been dishonored by non-acceptance or non-payment, notice of

www.suspicions.com

dishonor must be given to the
drawer and to each indorser, and
any drawer or indorser to whom
such notice is not given is discharged.
Section 90The notice may
be given by or on behalf of the
holder, or by or on behalf of any
party to the instrument who
might be compelled to pay it to
the holder, and who, upon taking it up would have a right to
reimbursement from the party to
whom the notice is given.
Section 91.Notice of dishonor may be given by an agent
either in his own name or in the
name of any party entitled to give
notice, whether that party be his
principal or not.
Section 92.Where notice is
given by or on behalf of the
holder, it enures for the benefit
of all subsequent holders and all
prior parties who have a right of
recourse against the party to
whom it is given.
Section 93.Where notice is
given by or on behalf of a party
entitled to give notice, it enures

time for giving notice as if the
agent had been an independent
holder.
Section 95.A written notice

by or on behalf of the principal

debtor;
(2) By payment in due course
by the party accommodated,
where the instrument is made or
accepted for accommodation;
(3) By the intentional cancellation thereof by the holder;
(4) By any other act which
will discharge a simple contract
for the payment of money;
(5) When the principal debtor
becomes the holder of the instrument at or after maturity in his
own right.
Section 120.A person secondarily liable on the instrument
is discharged:
(1) By any act which discharges the instrument;
(2) By the intentional cancellation of his signature by the
holder;
(3) By the discharge of a prior
party;
(4) By a valid tender of payment made by a prior party;
(5) By a release of the principal debtor, unless the holders
right of recourse against the
party secondarily liable is expressly reserved;
(6) By any agreement binding

may expressly renounce his
rights against any party to the
instrument, before, at or after its
maturity. An absolute and unconditional renunciation of his rights
against the principal debtor
made at or after the maturity of

does not affect the rights of a
holder in due course without
notice. A renunciation must be
in writing, unless the instrument

Section 123.A cancellation
made unintentionally, or under
a mistake or without the authority of the holder, is inoperative;

made unintentionally, or under
a mistake or without authority.
Section 124.Where a negotiable instrument is materially
altered without the assent of all
parties liable thereon, it is
avoided, except as against a
party who has himself made, authorized or assented to the alteration, and subsequent indorsers.

course, not a party to the alteration, he may enforce payment

ARTICLE II.ACCEPTANCE
Section 132.The acceptance of a bill is the signification
by the drawee of his assent to

means than the payment of
money.
Section 133.The holder of
a bill presenting the same for
acceptance may require that the
acceptance be written on the bill,
and, if such request is refused,
may treat the bill as dishonored.
Section 134.Where an acceptance is written on a paper

not bind the acceptor except in
favor of a person to whom it is
shown and who, on the faith

deemed an actual acceptance in

INTERPRETATION
Section 126.A bill of exchange is an unconditional order
in writing addressed by one person to another, signed by the
person giving it, requiring the
person to whom it is addressed
to pay on demand or at a fixed
or determinable future time a
sum certain in money to order
or to bearer.
Section 127.A bill of itself
does not operate as an assignment the funds in the hands of
the drawee available for the payment thereof, and the drawee is
not liable on the bill unless and
until he accepts the same.
Section 128.A bill may be
addressed to two or more drawees jointly, whether they are partners or not; but not to two or
more drawees in the alternative
or in succession.
Section 129.An inland bill
of exchange is a bill which is, or
on its face purports to be, both
drawn and payable within this
state. Any other bill is a foreign
bill. Unless the contrary appears
on the face of the bill, the holder
may treat it as an inland bill.
Section 130.Where in a bill
drawer and drawee are the same
person, or where the drawee is a
fictitious person, or a person not
having capacity to contract, the
holder may treat the instrument,
at his option, either as a bill of
exchange or a promissory note.
Section 131.The drawer of
a bill and any indorser may insert thereon the name of a person to whom the holder may resort in case of need, that is to

is overdue, or after it has been
dishonored by a previous refusal
to accept, or by nonpayment. But
when a bill payable after sight is
dishonored by nonacceptance
and the drawee subsequently accepts it, the holder, in the absence of any different agreement, is entitled to have the bill
accepted as of the date of the
first presentment.
Section 139.An acceptance
is either general or qualified. A
general acceptance assents without qualification to the order of
the drawer. A qualified acceptance in express terms varies the
effect of the bill as drawn.
Section 140.An acceptance
to pay at a particular place is a
general acceptance, unless it
expressly states that the bill is
to be paid there only and not
elsewhere.
Section 141.An acceptance
is qualified, which is:
(1) Conditional, that is to
say, which makes payment by the
acceptor dependent on the fulfillment of a condition therein
stated;
(2) Partial, that is to say, an
acceptance to pay part only of
the amount for which the bill is
drawn;
(3) Local, that is to say, an
acceptance to pay only at a particular place;
(4) Qualified as to time;
(5) The acceptance of some
one or more of the drawees, but
not of all.
Section 142.The holder
may refuse to take a qualified acceptance, and if he does not obtain an unqualified acceptance,
he may treat the bill as dishonored by non-acceptance. Where
a qualified acceptance is taken,
the drawer and indorsers are discharged from liability on the bill,
unless they have expressly or
impliedly authorized the holder
to take a qualified acceptance, or
subsequently assent thereto.
When the drawer or an indorser

receives notice of a qualified acceptance, he must, within a reasonable time, express his dissent
to the holder, or he will be
deemed to have assented
thereto.

and no presentment for payment
is necessary.
ARTICLE IV.PROTEST

to be such is dishonored by nonacceptance, it must be duly protested for non-acceptance, and
where such a bill which has not
previously been dishonored by
non-acceptance is dishonored by
non-payment, it must be duly
protested for non-payment. If it
is not so protested, the drawer
and indorsers are discharged.

for acceptance is excused, and a
bill may be treated as dishonored

has been protested for non-acceptance may be subsequently
protested for non-payment.
Section 158.Where the acceptor has been adjudged a
bankrupt or an insolvent or has
made an assignment for the benefit of creditors, before the bill
matures, the holder may cause
the bill to be protested for better security against the drawer
and indorsers.
Section 159.Protest is dispensed with by any circumstances which would dispense

mass as the number, weight or
measure bought bears to the
number, weight or measure of

(b) As transferring the property in all of the existing goods

goods in which the property
passes if the sale was divisible.

Goods Contracted to be Sold.
(1) Where there is a contract
to sell specific goods, and subsequently, but before the risk
passes to the buyer, without any
fault on the part. of the seller or
the buyer, the goods wholly perish, the contract is thereby
avoided.
(2) Where there is a contract
to sell specific goods, and subsequently, but before the risk
passes to the buyer, without any
fault of the seller or the buyer,
part of the goods perish or the
whole or a material part of the

character, the buyer may at his
option treat the contract:
(a) As avoided, or
(b) As binding the seller to
transfer the property in all of the
existing goods or in so much
thereof as have not deteriorated,

to sell or a sale of goods at a
price or on terms to be fixed by

avoided; but if the goods or any
part thereof have been delivered
to and appropriated by the buyer
he must pay a reasonable price
therefor.
(2) Where such third person

or terms by fault of the seller or

provisions of this act and of any
statute in that behalf, there is no
implied warranty or condition as
to the quality or fitness for any
particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract to sell or
a sale, except as follows:
(1) Where the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes
known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods
are required, and it appears that

or not), there is an implied
warranty that the goods shall be
reasonably fit for such purpose.

bought by description from a
seller who deals in goods of that
description (whether he be the
grower or manufacturer or not),
there is an implied warranty that
the goods shall be of merchantable quality.
(3) If the buyer has examined the goods, there is no implied warranty as regards defects
which such examination ought to
have revealed.

to sell or a sale of a specified article under its patent or other
trade name, there is no implied

warranty as to its fitness for any
particular purpose.
(5) An implied warranty or
condition as to quality or fitness
for a particular purpose may be
annexed by the usage of trade.
(6) An express warranty or
condition does not negative a
warranty or condition implied
under this act unless inconsistent therewith.

case of a contract to sell or a sale
by sample:
(a) There is an implied warranty that the bulk shall correspond with the sample in quality.

reasonable opportunity of comparing the bulk with the sample,

which would not be apparent on
reasonable examination of the
sample.

PROPERTY AS BETWEEN
SELLER AND BUYER

Passes until Goods Are Ascertained.Where there is a contract to sell unascertained goods
no property in the goods is transferred to the buyer unless and

the goods, and that in case of a
contract to sell he will have a
right to sell the goods at the time
when the property is to pass;

the buyer shall have and enjoy
quiet possession of the goods as
against any lawful claims existing at the time of the sale;

time of the sale from any charge
or encumbrance in favor of any
third person, not declared or
known to the buyer before or at

terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties, usages of
trade and the circumstances of
the case.

different intention appears, the
following are rules for ascertaining the intention of the parties
as to the time at which the property in the goods is to pass to
the buyer.

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

RULE 1.Where there is an
unconditional contract to sell
specific goods, in a deliverable
state, the property in the goods
passes to the buyer when the
contract is made and it is immaterial whether the time of payment, or the time of delivery, or
both, be postponed.

116

RULE 2.Where there is a
contract to sell specific goods
and the seller is bound to do
something to the goods, for the
purpose of puffing them into a
deliverable state, the property
does not pass until such thing
be done.
RULE 3.
(1) When goods are delivered
to the buyer on sale or return,
or on other terms indicating an
intention to make a present sale,
but to give the buyer an option
to return the goods instead of
paying the price, the property
passes to the buyer on delivery,
but he may revest the property
in the seller by returning or tendering the goods within the time
fixed in the contract, or, if no
time has been fixed, within a reasonable time.

(2) When goods are delivered to the buyer on approval or
on trial or on satisfaction, or
other similar terms, the property
therein passes to the buyer:
(a) When he signifies his approval or acceptance to the seller
or does any other act adopting
the transaction;
(b) If he does not signify his
approval or acceptance to the
seller, but retains the goods without giving notice of rejection,
then if a time has been fixed for
the return of the goods, on the
expiration of such time, and, if
no time has been fixed, on the
expiration of a reasonable time.
What is a reasonable time is a
question of fact
RULE 4.
(1) Where there is a contract
to sell unascertained or future
goods by description, and goods
of that description and in a deliverable state are unconditionally
appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent
of the buyer, or by the buyer with
the assent of the seller, the property in the goods thereupon
passes to the buyer. Such assent
may be expressed or implied, and
may be given either before or after the appropriation is made.
(2) Where, in pursuance of a
contract to sell, the seller delivers the goods to the buyer, or to
a carrier or other bailee (whether
named by the buyer or not) for
the purpose of transmission to
or holding for the buyer, he is
presumed to have unconditionally appropriated the goods to
the contract, except in the cases
provided for in the next rule and
in section 20. This presumption
is applicable, although by the
terms of the contract the buyer
is to pay the price before receiving delivery of the goods, and the
goods are marked with the words
collect on delivery or their
equivalents.

Suspicions News Magazine

RULE 5.If the contract to

www.suspicions.info

sell requires the seller to deliver
the goods to the buyer, or at a
particular place, or to pay the
freight or cost or transportation
to the buyer, or to a particular
place, the property does not pass
until the goods have been delivered to the buyer or reached
the place agreed upon.
Section 20. Reservation of
Right of Possession or Property
When Goods are shipped.
(1) Where there is a contract
to sell specific goods, or where
goods are subsequently appropriated to the contract, the seller
may, by the terms of the contract
or appropriation, reserve the
right of possession or property
in the goods until certain conditions have been fulfilled. The
right of possession or property
may be thus reserved notwithstanding the delivery of the
goods to the buyer or to a carrier or other bailee for the purpose of transmission to the
buyer.
(2) Where
goods
are
shipped, and by the bill of lading the goods are deliverable to
the seller or his agent, or to the
order of the seller or of his agent,
the seller thereby reserves the
property in the goods. But if,
except for the form of the bill of
lading, the property would have
passed to the buyer on shipment
of the goods, the sellers property in the goods shall be
deemed to be only for the purpose of securing performance by
the buyer of his obligations under the contract.
(3) Where
goods
are
shipped, and by the bill of lading the goods are deliverable to
the order of the buyer or of his
agent, but possession of the bill
of lading is retained by the seller
or his agent, the seller thereby
reserves a right to the possession of the goods as against the
buyer.
(4) Where the seller of goods
draws on the buyer for the price

and transmits the bill of exchange and bill of lading together to the buyer to secure
acceptance or payment of the bill
of exchange, the buyer is bound
to return the bill of lading if he
does not honor the bill of exchange, and if he wrongfully retains the bill of lading he acquires no added right thereby.
If, however, the bill of lading provides that the goods are deliverable to the buyer or to the
order of the buyer, or is indorsed
in blank, or to the buyer by the
consignee named therein, one
who purchases in good faith, for
value, the bill of lading, or goods
from the buyer will obtain the
property in the goods, although
the bill of exchange has not been
honored, provided that such purchaser has received delivery of
the bill of lading indorsed by the
consignee named therein, or of
the goods, without notice of the
facts making the transfer wrongful.

Section 22. Risk of Loss
Unless otherwise agreed, the
goods remain at the sellers risk
until the property therein is
transferred to the buyer, but
when the property therein is
transferred to the buyer the
goods are at the buyers risk
whether delivery has been made
or not, except that:
(a) Where delivery of the
goods has been made to the
buyer, or to a bailee for the
buyer, in pursuance of the contract and the property in the
goods has been retained by the
seller merely to secure performance by the buyer of his obligations under the contract, the
goods are at the buyers risk
from the time of such delivery.
(b) Where delivery has been
delayed through the fault of either buyer or seller the goods are
at the risk of the party in fault as
regards any loss which might not
have occurred but for such fault.
TRANSFER OF TITLE
Section 23. Sale by a Person
Not the Owner.
(1) Subject to the provisions
of this act, where goods are sold
by a person who is not the owner
thereof, and who does not sell
them under the authority or with
the consent of the owner, the
buyer acquires no better title to
the goods than the seller had,
unless the owner of the goods is
by his conduct precluded from
denying the sellers authority to
sell.
(2) Nothing in this act, however, shall affect:

www.suspicions.com

(a) The provisions of any factors acts, recording acts, or any
enactment enabling the apparent
owner of goods to dispose of
them as if he were the true owner
thereof.
(b) The validity of any contract
to sell or sale under any special
common law or statutory power
of sale or under the order of a
court of competent jurisdiction.
Section 24. Sale by One Having a Voidable Title.Where the
seller of goods has a voidable
title thereto, but his title has not
been avoided at the time of the
sale, the buyer acquires a good
title to the goods, provided he
buys them in good faith, for
value, and without notice of the
sellers defect of title.
Section 25. Sale by Seller in
Possession of Goods Already
Sold.Where a person having
sold goods continues in possession of the goods, or of negotiable documents of title to the
goods, the delivery or transfer by
that person, or by an agent acting for him, of the goods or documents of title under any sale,
pledge, or other disposition
thereof, to any person receiving
and paying value for the same in
good faith and without notice of
the previous sale, shall have the
same effect as if the person making the delivery or transfer were
expressly authorized by the
owner of the goods to make the
same. [Compare Sales Act, Secs.
20(4), 23, and 27 through 40.]
Section 26. Creditors Rights
against Sold Goods in Sellers
Possession.Where a person
having sold goods continues in
possession of the goods, or of
negotiable documents of title to
the goods and such retention of
possession is fraudulent in fact
or is deemed fraudulent under
any rule of law, a creditor or
creditors of the seller may treat
the sale as void.

Suspicions News Magazine

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

Section 21. Sale by Auction.In the case of sale by auction:
(1) Where goods are put up
for sale by auction in lots, each
lot is the subject of a separate
contract of sale.
(2) A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer announces its completion by the
fall of the hammer, or in other
customary manner. Until such
announcement is made, any bidder may retract his bid; and the
auctioneer may withdraw the
goods from sale unless the auction has been announced to be
without reserve.
(3) A right to bid may be reserved expressly by or on behalf
of the seller.
(4) Where notice has not
been given that a sale by auction
is subject to a right to bid on
behalf of the seller, it shall not
be lawful for the seller to bid himself or to employ or induce any
person to bid at such sale on his

behalf, or for the auctioneer to
employ or induce any person to
bid at such sale on behalf of the
seller or knowingly to take any
bid from the seller or any person employed by him. Any sale
contravening this rule may be
treated as fraudulent by the
buyer.

Section 27. Definition of Negotiable Documents of Title. A
document of title in which it is
stated that the goods referred to
therein will be delivered to the
bearer, or to the order of any
person named in such document
is a negotiable document of title..

118

Section 28. Negotiation of
Negotiable Documents by Delivery.A negotiable document
of title may be negotiated by delivery:
(a) Where by the terms of the
document the carrier, warehouseman or other bailee issuing the same undertakes to deliver the goods to the bearer, or
(b) Where by the terms of the
document the carrier, warehouseman or other bailee issuing the same undertakes to deliver the goods to the order of a
specified person, and such person or a subsequent indorsee of
the document has indorsed it in
blank or to bearer.
Where by the terms of a negotiable document of title the
goods are deliverable to bearer
or where a negotiable document
of title has been indorsed in
blank or to bearer, any holder
may indorse the same to himself
or to any other specified person,
and in such case the document
shall thereafter be negotiated
only by the indorsement of such
indorsee.
Section 29. Negotiation of
Negotiable Documents by
Indorsement.A negotiable
document of title may be negotiated by the indorsement of the
person to whose order the goods
are by the terms of the document
deliverable. Such indorsement
may be in blank, to bearer or to
a specified person. If indorsed to
a specified person, it may be
again negotiated by the indorsement of such person in blank, to
bearer or to another specified
person. Subsequent negotiation
may be made in like manner.

Section 30. Negotiable Documents of Title (marked not negotiable.)If a document of title
which contains an undertaking
by a carrier, warehouseman or
other bailee to deliver the goods
to the bearer, to a specified person or order, or to the order of a
specified person, or which contains words of like import, has
placed upon it the words not
negotiable, non-negotiable or
the like, such a document may
nevertheless be negotiated by
the holder and is a negotiable
document of title within the
meaning of this act. But nothing
in this act contained shall be construed as limiting or defining the
effect upon the obligations of the
carrier, warehouseman, or other
bailee issuing a document of title
of placing thereon the words not
negotiable, nonnegotiable, or
the like.
Section 31. Transfer of Nonnegotiable Documents.A document of title which is not in such
form that it can be negotiated by
delivery may be transferred by
the holder by delivery to a purchaser or donee. A non-negotiable document can not be negotiated and the indorsement of
such a document gives the transferee no additional right.
Section 32. Who May Negotiate
a Document.A negotiable document of title may be negotiated:
(a) By the owner thereof, or
(B) By any person to whom
the possession or custody of the
document has been entrusted by
the owner, if, by the terms of the
document the bailee issuing the
document undertakes to deliver
the goods to the order of the
person to whom the possession
or custody of the document has
been entrusted, or if at the time
of such entrusting the document is in such form that it may
be negotiated by delivery.

read:
Section 32. [Who May Negotiate a Document.] A negotiable
document of title may be negotiated by any person in possession
of the same, however such possession may have been acquired
if, by the terms of the document,
the bailee issuing it undertakes
to deliver the goods to the order
of such person, or if at the time
of negotiation the document is
in such form that it may be negotiated by delivery.]
Section 33. Rights of Person

Negotiated.A person to whom
a negotiable document of title
has been duly negotiated acquires thereby:
(a) Such title to the goods as
the person negotiating the document to him had or had ability
to convey to a purchaser in good
faith for value and also such title
to the goods as the person to
whose order the goods were to
be delivered by the terms of the
document had or had ability to
convey to a purchaser in good
faith for value, and
(B) The direct obligation of
the bailee issuing the document
to hold possession of the goods

of the document as fully as if
such bailee had contracted directly with him.
Section 34. Rights of Persons
to Whom Document Has Been
Transferred.A person to whom
a document of title has been
transferred, but not negotiated,
acquires thereby, as against the
transferor, the title to the goods,
subject to the terms of any agreement with the transferor.
If the document is non-negotiable, such person also acquires
the right to notify the bailee who
issued the document of the
transfer thereof, and thereby to

acquire the direct obligation of
such bailee to hold possession of the goods for him according to the terms of the document.
Prior to the notification of
such bailee by the transferor or
transferee of a non-negotiable
document of title, the title of the
transferee to the goods and the
right to acquire the obligation of
such bailee may be defeated by
the levy of an attachment or execution upon the goods by a
creditor of the transferor or by a
notification to such bailee by the
transferor or a subsequent purchaser from the transferor of a
subsequent sale of the goods by
the transferor.
Section 35. Transfer of Negotiable Document without Indorsement.Where a negotiable
document of title is transferred
for value by delivery, and the indorsement of the transferor is
essential for negotiation, the
transferee acquires a right
against the transferor to compel
him to indorse the document
unless a contrary intention appears. The negotiation shall take
effect as of the time when the
indorsement is actually made.

(a) That the document is
genuine;
(b) That he has a legal right
to negotiate or transfer it;
(c) That he has knowledge of
no fact which would impair the
validity or worth of the document, and
(d) That he has a right to
transfer the title to the goods
and that the goods are merchantable or fit for a particular pur-

Section 37. Indorser Not a
Guarantor.The indorsement of
a document of title shall not
make the indorser liable for any
failure on the part of the bailee who issued the document or
previous indorsers thereof to fulfill their respective obligations.
Section 38. When Negotiation Not Impaired by Fraud, Mistake or Duress.The validity of
the negotiation of a negotiable
document of title is not impaired
by the fact that the negotiation
was a breach of duty on the part
of the person making the negotiation, or by the fact that the
owner of the document was induced by fraud, mistake or duress to entrust the possession or
custody thereof to such person,
if the person to whom the document was negotiated or a person
to whom the document was subsequently negotiated paid value
therefor, without notice of the
breach of duty, or fraud, mistake
or duress.
[Under the Sales Act Amendments of 1922 the section would
read:
Section 38. [When Negotiation Not Impaired by Fraud, Mistake or Duress.] The validity of the
negotiation of a negotiable document of title is not impaired by
the fact that the negotiation was
a breach of duty on the part of
the person making the negotiation, or by the fact that the owner
of the document was deprived of
the possession of the same by
loss, theft, fraud, accident, mistake, duress, or conversion, if the
person to whom the document
was negotiated or a person to
whom the document was subse-

quently negotiated paid value
therefor in good faith without
notice of the breach of duty, or
loss, theft, fraud, accident, mistake, duress or conversion.]
Section 39. Attachment or
Levy upon Goods for Which a
Negotiable Document Has Been
Issued.If goods are delivered to
a bailee by the owner or by a
person whose act in conveying
the title to them to a purchaser
in good faith for value would
bind the owner and a negotiable
document of title is issued for
them they can not thereafter,
while in the possession of such
bailee, be attached by garnishment or otherwise or be levied
upon under an execution unless
the document be first surrendered to the bailee or its negotiation enjoined. The bailee shall
in no case be compelled to deliver up the actual possession of
the goods until the document is
surrendered to him or impounded by the court.
Section 40. Creditors Remedies to Reach Negotiable Documents.A creditor whose debtor
is the owner of a negotiable
document of title shall be entitled to such aid from courts of
appropriate jurisdiction by injunction and otherwise in attaching such document or in satisfying the claim by means thereof
as is allowed at law or in equity
in regard to property which can
not readily be attached or levied
upon by ordinary legal process.
PART III. PERFORMANCE
OF THE CONTRACT
Section 41. Seller Must Deliver and Buyer Accept Goods.
It is the duty of the seller to deliver the goods, and of the buyer
to accept and pay for them, in
accordance with the terms of the
contract to sell or sale.

Suspicions News Magazine

Section 36. Warranties on
sale of document.A person
who for value negotiates or
transfers a document of title by
indorsement or delivery, including one who assigns for value a
claim secured by a document of
title unless a contrary intention
appears, warrants:

pose, whenever such warranties
would have been implied if the
contract of the parties had been
to transfer without a document
of title the goods represented
thereby.

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

Section 42. Delivery and Payment are Concurrent Conditions.
Unless otherwise agreed,
delivery of the goods and payment
of the price are concurrent conditions; that is to say, the seller must
be ready and willing to give possession of the goods to the buyer
in exchange for the price and the
buyer must be ready and willing
to pay the price in exchange for
possession of the goods.

120

Section 43. Place, Time and
Manner of Delivery.(1) Whether
it is for the buyer to take possession of the goods or for the
seller to send them to the buyer
is a question depending in each
case on the contract, express or
implied, between the parties.
Apart from any such contract,
express or implied, or usage of
trade to the contrary, the place
of delivery is the sellers place of
business if he have one, and if
not his residence; but in the case
of a contract to sell or a sale of
specific goods, which to the
knowledge of the parties
when the contract or the sale was
made were in some other place,
then that place is the place of
delivery.
(2) Where by a contract to sell
or a sale the seller is bound to
send the goods to the buyer, but
no time for sending them is
fixed, the seller is bound to send
them within a reasonable time.
(3) Where the goods at the
time of sale are in the possession of a third person, the seller
has not fulfilled his obligation to
deliver to the buyer unless and
until such third person acknowledges to the buyer that he holds
the goods on the buyers behalf;
but as against all others than the
seller the buyer shall be regarded
as having received delivery from
the time when such third person
first has notice of the sale. Nothing in this section, however, shall
affect the operation of the issue
or transfer of any document of
title to goods.

(4) Demand or tender of delivery may be treated as ineffectual unless made at a reasonable
hour. What is a reasonable hour
is a question of fact.
(5) Unless otherwise agreed,
the expenses of and incidental
to putting the goods into a deliverable state must be borne by
the seller.
Section Delivery of Wrong
Quantity.(1) Where the seller
delivers to the buyer a quantity
of goods less than he contracted
to sell, the buyer may reject
them, but if the buyer accepts or
retains the goods so delivered,
knowing that the seller is not
going to perform the contract in
full, he must pay for them at the
contract rate. If, however, the
buyer has used or disposed of
the goods delivered before he
knows that the seller is not going to perform his contract in full,
the buyer shall not be liable for
more than the fair value to him
of the goods so received.
(2) Where the seller delivers
to the buyer a quantity of goods
larger than he contracted to sell,
the buyer may accept the goods
included in the contract and reject the rest, or he may reject the
whole. If the buyer accepts
the whole of the goods so delivered he must pay for them at the
contract rate.
(3) Where the seller delivers
to the buyer the goods he contracted to sell mixed with goods
of a different description not included in the contract, the buyer
may accept the goods which are
in accordance with the contract
and reject the rest, or he may
reject the whole.
(4) The provisions of this section are subject to any usage-of
trade, special agreement, or
course of dealing between the
parties.
Section 45. Delivery in Installments.(1) Unless otherwise
agreed, the buyer of goods is not

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

bound to accept delivery thereof
by installments.
(2) Where there is a contract
to sell goods to be delivered by
stated installments, which are to
be separately paid for, and the
seller makes defective deliveries
in respect of one or more installments, or the buyer neglects
or refuses to take delivery of or
pay for one or more installments,
it depends in each case on the
terms of the contract and the circumstances of the case, whether
the breach of contract is so material as to justify the injured
party in refusing to proceed further and suing for damages for
breach of the entire contract, or
whether the breach is severable,
giving rise to a claim for compensation, but not to a right to treat
the whole contract as broken.
Section 46. Delivery to a Carrier on Behalf of the Buyer. (1)
Where, in pursuance of a contract
to sell or a sale, the seller is authorized or required to send the
goods to the buyer, delivery of
the goods to a carrier, whether
named by the buyer or not, for
the purpose of transmission to
the buyer is deemed to be a delivery of the goods to the buyer,
except in the cases provided for
in section 19, Rule 5, or unless a
contrary intent appears.
(2) Unless otherwise authorized by the buyer, the seller
must make such contract with
the carrier on behalf of the buyer
as may be reasonable, having
regard to the nature of the goods
and the other circumstances of
the case. If the seller omit so to
do,
and the goods are lost or
damaged in course of transit, the
buyer may decline to treat the
delivery to the carrier as a delivery to himself, or may hold the
seller responsible in damages.
(3) Unless otherwise agreed,
where goods are sent by the
seller to the buyer under circumstances in which the seller knows

or ought to know that it is usual
to insure, the seller must give
such notice to the buyer as may
enable him to insure them during their transit, and, if the seller
fails to do so, the goods shall be
deemed to be at his risk during
such transit.

Section 48. What Constitutes
Acceptance.The buyer is
deemed to have accepted the
goods when he intimates to the
seller that he has accepted them,
or when the goods have been
delivered to him, and he does any
act in relation to them which is
inconsistent with the ownership
of the seller, or when, after the
lapse of a reasonable time, he
retains the goods without inti-

Section 50. Buyer Is Not
Bound to Return Goods Wrongly
Delivered.Unless otherwise
agreed, where the goods are delivered to the buyer, and he refuses to accept them, having the
right to do so, he is not bound
to return them, to the seller, but
it is sufficient if he notifies the
seller that he refused to accept
them.
Section 51. Buyers Liability
for Failing to Accept Delivery.
When the seller is ready and willing to deliver the goods, and requests the buyer to take delivery, and the buyer does not
within a reasonable time after
such request take delivery of the
goods, he is liable to the seller
for any loss occasioned by his
neglect or refusal to take delivery, and also for a reasonable
charge for the care and custody
of the goods. If the neglect or
refusal of the buyer to take delivery amounts to a repudiation
or breach of the entire contract,
the seller shall have the rights
against the goods and on the
contract hereinafter provided in
favor of the seller when the buyer
is in default.

goods is deemed to be an unpaid
seller within the meaning of this
act
(a) When the whole of the
price has not been paid or tendered.
(b) When a bill of exchange
or other negotiable instrument
has been received as conditional
payment, and the condition on
which it was received has been
broken by reason of the dishonor
of the instrument, the insolvency

(2) In this part of this act the
term seller includes an agent

(b) In case of the insolvency
of the buyer, a right of stopping
the goods in transitu after he has

Section 47. Right to Examine
the Goods.(1) Where goods are
delivered to the buyer, which he
has not previously examined, he
is not deemed to have accepted
them unless and until he has had
a reasonable opportunity of examining them for the purpose of
ascertaining whether they are in
conformity with the contract.
(2) Unless otherwise agreed,
when the seller tenders delivery
of goods to the buyer, he is
bound, on request, to afford the
buyer a reasonable opportunity
of examining the goods for the
purpose of ascertaining whether
they are in conformity with the
contract.
(3) Where the goods are delivered to a carrier by the seller,
in accordance with an order from
or agreement with the buyer,
upon the terms that the goods
shall not be delivered by the carrier to the buyer until he has paid
the price, whether such terms are
indicated by marking the goods
with the words collect on delivery, or otherwise, the buyer is
not entitled to examine the
goods before payment of the
price in the absence of agreement permitting such examination.

mating to the seller that he has
rejected them.
Section 49. Acceptance Does
Not Bar Action for Damages.
In the absence of express
or implied agreement of the parties, acceptance of the goods by
the buyer shall not discharge the
seller from liability in damages
or other legal remedy for breach
of any promise or warranty in the
contract to sell or the sale. But,
if, after acceptance of the goods,
the buyer fail to give notice to
the seller of the breach of any
promise or warranty within a reasonable time after the buyer
knows, or ought to know of such
breach, the seller shall not be liable therefor.

as to credit;
(b) Where the goods have
been sold on credit, but the term
of credit has expired;
(c) Where the buyer becomes insolvent.
(2) The seller may exercise
his right of lien notwithstanding

buyer.

122

Section 55. Lien after Part
Delivery.Where an unpaid
seller has made part delivery of
the goods, he may exercise his
right of lien on the remainder,
unless such part delivery has
been made under such circumstances as to show an intent to
waive the lien or right of retention.
Section 56. When Lien Is
Lost.(1) The unpaid seller of
goods loses his lien thereon,
(a) When he delivers the
goods to a carrier or other bailee for the purpose of transmission to the buyer without reserving the property in goods or the
right to the possession thereof;
(b) When the buyer or his
agent lawfully obtains possession of the goods;
(c) By waiver thereof.

(2) The unpaid seller of
goods, having a lien thereon,
does not lose his lien by reason
only that he has obtained judgment or decree for the price of
the goods.

Section 57. Seller May Stop
Goods on Buyers Insolvency.
Subject to the provisions of this
act, when the buyer of goods is
or becomes insolvent, the unpaid
seller who has parted with the
possession of the goods has
the right of stopping them in
transitu, that is to say, he may
resume possession of the goods
at any time while they are in transit, and he will then become entitled to the same rights in regard to the goods as he would
have had if he had never parted
with the possession.

possession of them as bailee for
the buyer or his agent; and it is
immaterial that a further destination for the goods may have
been indicated by the buyer;
(c) If the carrier or other bailee wrongfully refuses to deliver
the goods to the buyer or his
agent in that behalf.
(3) If the goods are delivered
to a ship chartered by the buyer,
it is a question depending on the
circumstances of the particular
case, whether they are in the
possession of the master as a
carrier or as agent of the buyer.
(4) If part delivery of the
goods has been made to the
buyer, or his agent in that behalf,
the remainder of the goods may
be stopped in transitu, unless
such part delivery has been made
under such circumstances as
to show an agreement with the
buyer to give up possession of
the whole of the goods.

Section 58. When Goods Are
in Transit.
(1) Goods are in transit within
the meaning of Section 57,
(a) From the time when they
are delivered to a carrier by land
or water, or other bailee for the
purpose of transmission to the
buyer, until the buyer, or his
agent in that behalf, takes delivery of them from such carrier
or other bailee;
(b) If the goods are rejected
by the buyer, and the carrier or
other bailee continues in possession of them, even if the seller
has refused to receive them back.

(a) If the buyer, or his agent
in that behalf, obtains delivery of
the goods before their arrival at

goods at the appointed destination, the carrier or other bailee
acknowledges to the buyer or his
agent that he holds the goods
on his behalf and continues in

Section Ways of Exercising
the Right to Stop.
(1) The unpaid seller may
exercise his right of stoppage in
transitu either by obtaining actual possession of the goods or
by giving notice of his claim to
the carrier or other bailee in
whose possession the goods are.
Such notice may be given either
to the person in actual possession of the goods or to his principal. In the latter case the notice, to be effectual, must be
given at such time and under
such circumstances that the principal, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, may prevent a
delivery to the buyer.
(2) When notice of stoppage
in transitu is given by the seller
to the carrier, or other bailee in
possession of the goods, he
must redeliver the goods to, or
according to the directions of,
the seller. The expenses of such
delivery must be borne by the
seller. If, however, a negotiable
document of title representing
the goods has been issued by the

STOPPAGE IN TRANSITU

Suspicions News Magazine

carrier or other bailee, he shall
not be obliged to deliver or justified in delivering the goods to
the seller unless such document
is first surrendered for cancellation.
RESALE BY THE SELLER

RESCISSION BY THE SELLER
Section 61. When and How
the Seller May Rescind the Sale.
(1) An unpaid seller having a
right of lien or having stopped
the goods in transitu, may rescind the transfer of title and
resume the property in the
goods, where he expressly reserved the right to do so in case
the buyer should make default,
or where the buyer has been in
default in the payment of the
price an unreasonable time. The
seller shall not thereafter be liable to the buyer upon the contract to sell or the sale, but may
recover from the buyer damages
for any loss occasioned by the
breach of the contract or the sale.
(2) The transfer of title shall
not be held to have been rescinded by an unpaid seller until
he has manifested by notice to
the buyer or by some other overt
act an intention to rescind. It is
not necessary that such overt act
should be communicated to the
buyer, but the giving or failure
to give notice to the buyer of the
intention to rescind shall be relevant in any issue involving the
question whether the buyer had
been in default an unreasonable
time before the right of rescission was asserted.
Section 62. Effect of Sale of
Goods Subject to Lien or Stoppage in TransituSubject to the
provisions of this act, the unpaid
sellers right of lien or stoppage
in transitu is not affected by any
sale, or other disposition of the
goods which the buyer may have
made, unless the seller has assented thereto.
If, however, a negotiable
document of title has been issued for goods, no sellers lien
or right or stoppage in transitu

www.suspicions.com

shall defeat the right of any purchaser for value in good faith to
whom such document has been
negotiated, whether such negotiation be prior or subsequent to
the notification to the carrier, or
other bailee who issued such
document, of the sellers claim
to a lien or right of stoppage in
transitu.
PART V. ACTIONS FOR
BREACH OF THE CONTRACT
REMEDIES OF THE SELLER
Section 63. Action for the
Price.
( 1) Where, under a contract
to sell or a sale, the property in
the goods has passed to the
buyer, and the buyer wrongfully
neglects or refuses to pay for the
goods according to the terms of
the contract or the sale, the seller
may maintain an action against
him for the price of the goods.
(2) Where, under a contract
to sell or a sale, the price is payable on a day certain, irrespective of delivery or of transfer of
title, and the buyer wrongfully
neglects or refuses to pay such
price, the seller may maintain an
action for the price, although the
property in the goods has not
passed, and the goods have not
been appropriated to the contract. But it shall be a defense to
such an action that the seller at
any time before the judgment in
such action has manifested an
inability to perform the contract
or the sale on his part or an intention not to perform it.
(3) Although the property in
the goods has not passed, if they
can not readily be resold for a
reasonable price, and if the provisions of section 64 (4) are not
applicable, the seller may offer
to deliver the goods to the buyer,
and, if the buyer refuses to receive them, may notify the buyer
that the goods are thereafter
held by the seller as bailee for

Suspicions News Magazine

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

Section 60. When and How
Resale May Be Made.
(1) Where the goods are of a
perishable nature, or where the
seller expressly reserves the
right of resale in case the buyer
should make default, or where
the buyer has been in default in
the payment of the price an unreasonable time, an unpaid seller
having a right of lien or having
stopped the goods in transitu
may resell the goods. He shall
not thereafter be liable to the
original buyer upon the contract
to sell or the sale or for any profit
made by such resale, but may
recover from the buyer damages
for any loss occasioned by the
breach of the contract or the sale.
(2) Where a resale is made,
as authorized in this section, the
buyer acquires a good title as
against the original buyer.
(3) It is not essential to the
validity of a resale that notice of
an intention to resell the goods
be given by the seller to the original buyer. But where the right to
resell is not based on the perishable nature of the goods or upon
an express provision of the contract or the sale, the giving or
failure to give such notice shall
be relevant in any issue involving the question whether the
buyer had been in default an
unreasonable time before the
resale was made.
(4) It is not essential to the
validity of a resale that notice of
the time and place of such resale
should be given by the seller to
the original buyer.
(5) The seller is bound to
exercise reasonable care and
judgment in making a resale, and

subject to this requirement may
make a resale either by public or
private sale.

123

National Law Library Volume 4 Business Law

the buyer. Thereafter the seller
may treat the goods as the
buyers and may maintain an action for the price.

124

Section 64. Action for Damages for Non-acceptance of the
Goods.
(1) Where the buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to accept
and pay for the goods, the seller
may maintain an action against
him for damages for non-acceptance.
(2) The measure of damages
is the estimated loss directly and
naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the
buyers breach of contract.
(3) Where there is an available market for the goods in
question, the measure of damages is, in the absence of special circumstances, showing
proximate damage of a greater
amount, the difference between
the contract price and the market or current price at the time
or times when the goods ought
to have been accepted, or, if no
time was fixed for acceptance,
then at the time of the refusal to
accept.
(4) If, while labor or expense
of material amount are necessary
on the part of the seller to enable
him to fulfill his obligations under the contract to sell or the sale,
the buyer repudiates the contract
or the sale, or notifies the seller
to proceed no further therewith,
the buyer shall be liable to the
seller for no greater damages
than the seller would have suffered if he did nothing towards
carrying out the contract or the
sale after receiving notice of the
buyers repudiation or countermand. The profit the seller would
have made if the contract or the
sale had been fully performed
shall be considered in estimating
such damages.
Section 65. When Seller May
Rescind Contract or Sale.
Where the goods have not been

delivered to the buyer, and the
buyer has repudiated the contract to sell or sale, or has manifested his inability to perform his
obligations thereunder, or has
committed a material breach
thereof, the seller may totally
rescind the contract or the sale
by giving notice of his election
so to do to the buyer.
REMEDIES OF THE BUYER
Section 66. Action for Converting or Detaining Goods.
Where the property in the goods
has passed to the buyer and the
seller wrongfully neglects or refuses to deliver the goods, the
buyer may maintain any action
allowed by law to the owner of
goods of similar kind when
wrongfully converted or withheld.
Section 67. Action for Failing
to Deliver Goods.
(1) Where the property in the
goods has not passed to the
buyer, and the seller wrongfully
neglects or refuses to deliver the
goods, the buyer may maintain
an action against the seller for
damages for non-delivery.
(2) The measure of damages
is the loss directly and naturally
resulting in the ordinary course
of events, from the sellers
breach of contract.
(3) Where there is an available market for the goods in
question, the measure of damages, in the absence of special
circumstances showing proximate damages of a greater
amount, is the difference between the contract price and the
market or current price of the
goods at the time or times when
they ought to have been delivered, or, if no time was fixed,
then at the time of the refusal to
deliver.
Section 68. Specific Performance.Where the seller has

Suspicions News Magazine

www.suspicions.info

broken a contract to deliver specific or ascertained goods, a
court having the powers of a
court of equity may, if it thinks
fit, on the application of the
buyer, by its judgment or decree
direct that the contract shall be
performed specifically, without
giving the seller the option of
retaining the goods on payment
of damages. The judgment or
decree may be unconditional, or
upon such terms and conditions
as to damages, payment of the
price and otherwise, as to the
court may seem just.
Section 69. Remedies for
Breach of Warranty.
(1) Where there is a breach
of warranty by the seller, the
buyer may, at his election:
(a) Accept or keep the goods
and set up against the seller, the
breach of warranty by way of recoupment in diminution or extinction of the price;
(b) Accept or keep the goods
and maintain an action against
the seller for damages for the
breach of warranty;
(c) Refuse to accept the
goods, if the property therein has
not passed, and maintain an action against the seller for damages for the breach of warranty;
(d) Rescind the contract to
sell or the sale and refuse to receive the goods, or if the goods
have already been received, return them or offer to return them
to the seller and recover the price
or any part thereof which has
been paid.
(2) When the buyer has
claimed and been granted a remedy in any one of these ways, no
other remedy can thereafter be
granted.
(3) Where the goods have
been delivered to the buyer he
can not rescind the sale if he
knew of the breach of warranty
when he accepted the goods, or
if he fails to notify the seller
within a reasonable time of the
election to rescind, or if he fails
to return or to offer to return the

Section 70. Interest and Special Damages.Nothing in this

act shall affect the right of the
buyer or the seller to recover interest or special damages in any
case where by law interest or
special damages may be recoverable, or to recover money paid
where the consideration for the
payment of it has failed.
PART VI. INTERPRETATION
Section 71. Variation of Implied Obligations.Where any

It is defined as an association formed to conduct business for profit, with partners agreeing to share both the profits and losses incurred. The legal framework surrounding partnerships ensures that the responsibilities and authority of each partner are clearly delineated, which is essential for effective management and operation of the business.\n\nOverall, partnerships provide a flexible business structure that accommodates individual variations in agreements while maintaining a cohesive approach to shared ownership and management responsibilities.",

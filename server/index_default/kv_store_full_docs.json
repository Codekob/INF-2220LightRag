    "content": "Introduction\nBusiness Law is not in the Anglo-American\nsystem a clearly separable layer of law. It is made\nup of any and all propositions from every part\nof the constitutions, statutes and decisionsto\nwhich must be added administrative orders and\ndecrees and legally recognizable customsthat\nmay be pertinent to any business situation. And\nas the term business itself is rather expansive,\nwe may start with the assumption that no proposition in the law books can be dogmatically ruled\nout of the scope of business law. For convenience, however, we may recognize at once certain divisions of the law as more or less likely to\nbe involved in the everyday pursuits connected\nwith earning a livelihood. We may thus set aside\nas beyond the scope of this volume the whole\nof public law (Vol. III), of criminal law (Vol. II), of\nfamily law (Vol. VI, Part II), of property law (Vol.\nV), and even much of torts and contracts (Vol.\nVI, Part I). There remains a good deal of the law\nof contracts, particularly the contracts of buyer\nand seller, of employer and employee, of borrower and lender, of insurer and insured, of carrier and passenger or shipper, of the parties to\nnegotiable paper and of the members of a business organization. There remains, too, a great\ndeal that is not simply contractual in the sense\nof being based on consent, but, rather, is dictated by authority, about the conditions of the\nmarket, about credit, about business organization.\nMany of these matters are covered by separate commercial codes in countries where the\nlaw is codified. Hence on the continent of Europe the courts, courses, books and periodicals\ndevoted to Commercial Law have artificial\nboundaries within which prominent places are\noccupied by the law of Negotiable Instruments,\nPartnership and Corporations, and a great deal\nof ingenuity is developed in distinguishing between the transactions and persons that fall\nwithin the purview of the commercial code and\nthose which are to be judged by the general\ncode.\nIt is no mere accident that the Anglo-American system insists that all persons are governed\nby one law, whether they be merchants or not.\nThat matter was fought out in England in the\nseventeenth century. Prior to that time the Kings\nCourts had taken little notice of the disputes of\nmerchants. They were handled in petty special\ncourts, such as the Court of the Fairs. In the\n\nwww.suspicions.info\n\n\fearly seventeenth century Lord Coke, Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, by his decisions, his\nwriting; and his political activity, succeeded in\nreducing these petty courts to insignificance and\nin transferring their jurisdiction to the Kings\nCourts, and reducing their laws to recognizable customs. As late as 1622 Gerard Malynes\ninforms us that these customs apply only to\nmerchants. A gentleman cannot be a party to\ncommercial paper. But before the end of the\ncentury the courts are telling us that whoever\nsigns such paper becomes ad hoc a trader.1 Between these two views lie several generations\nduring which Englishmen are superseding foreigners as merchants. So the Courts Merchant\nare suppressed, but the law merchant becomes\npart of the law of the land for everybody, and\nmerchants are subject to the fused law of which\ntheir old customs are but a part.\nThis rule of one law for all was quite acceptable in the eighteenth century, particularly on\nthis side of the Atlantic where it fitted well not\nonly with political prejudices but also with social and economic facts. In pioneer life,\nWhen Adam dolve, and Eve span,\nWho was then the gentleman?\n\n1\n\nWitherley v. Sarsfield, Court of Kings Bench,\n1689. 1 Shower 125; Carthew 82. (L.B.P., p. 46.)\n2 Lincoln\n\nv.

In\nthis volume the additional abbreviation LB.P.\nrefers to the authors Law in Business Problems,\n\nwww.suspicions.com\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\nLikewise, who was the artisan, who the\ntrader, who the farmer and who the professional\nman? Obviously, the division of persons into\nsuch classes for legal purposes would not have\ncorresponded to the facts of life. So the doctrine of the equality of all men was written into\nour fundamental law. Our constitutions have\ncondemned as class legislation all attempts to\ndeal with one occupation in a special way unless they showed the clearest justification or,\nbetter still, were phrased in generalizations\nwhich negatived discrimination even while they\nsingled out instances on the basis of a recognizable principle.\nStill, subtle influences were at work in the\nnineteenth century to develop in our law a new\ndifferentiation between traders and the general\npublic and among traders themselves. These influences operated principally through reading\nimplications into contracts. The person regularly\nengaged in a business was understood to have\nmade certain representations to the public as\nto his skill. It was one thing for a charwoman to\nsew a dress inside out, and quite another for a\nprofessional dressmaker to do so.2 It is one\nthing for an iceman, who genially agrees to take\nyour trunk to the railroad station, to mishandle\nit, and quite another for the regular expressman to do so.3 In recent years the difference\n\nbetween the professional and the amateur in\nbusiness has been emphasized by statutes\nstatutes requiring licenses and sometimes examinations before one can hang out a shingle;\nstatutes pertaining to particular businesses, in\nspite of their general terminology; statutes singling out particular businesses (in spite of the\nconstitutional prejudice in favor of generality),\neither on the score of police power or the states\nright to regulate public utilities and other businesses affected with a public interest, or because\nof a peculiar opportunity of the state to bargain\nthrough its power to withhold or give conditionally a charter or franchise or other privilege. It\nis thus possible today, once more to speak not\nonly of a law of business in a narrow sense, but\nalso of the law of special businesses such as\nbanking, public utilities, stock brokerage, real\nestate brokerage, retailing, chain stores, advertising, insurance, or even peddling, plumbing\nor conducting a beauty parlor.\nThe scope of our present study is, of course,\nbroader. We include the activities of the market\nplace, the factory, the bank, the exchange, the\noffice, the directors room, the stockholders\nmeeting, and we even look into the court and\nthe public administrative office when these are\nthe situs of business transactions. Our order of\nprocedure will deviate somewhat from that usually pursued in books on business law. Instead\nof enumerating what the law provides in the way\nof rules, standards, principles and institutions\nand leaving their application to business needs\nto be dealt with as an afterthoughtthus beginning with an answer and seeking appropriate questionswe shall proceed to ask what are\nthe requirements of business and then turn to\nthe law to see what it has to offer for their satisfaction. This is, of course, the order of procedure in life, when the business man brings his\nproblem to the lawyer.4\n\n3\n\n\fContents\n2 Introduction\n\n20 III.\n\n7 I.

Frontiers of Business Law\n\n113 Uniform Sales Act\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nwww.suspicions.info\n\n\fChapter I\n\nBusiness Postulates\n& the Law\nin a shop with reasonable safety,\nand although we occasionally\nread of holdups showing the danger of such an assumption, we\ngo on making it. Why? Is it because of our faith in the habits\nof mankind, or in the workings\nof the legal system, or some doctrine of chance, or because of our\nown recklessness, or a combination of all of these? The question\nbecomes infinitely more complicated if, for such elementary human interests as security from\nholdups, we substitute the vast\nnetwork of relations that we call\nthe credit system, which is another of the postulates of modem\nbusiness.\nWithout going far into the\nanalysis of the basis of any one\nof these expectations, we may\nventure two propositions: first,\nthat the legal system of any given\ntime or place contributes heavily\nto the fulfillment of our expectations; and second, that the legal\nsystem is by no means alone in\nthis function. The first of these\npropositions is, of course, generally taken for granted. It is our\npurpose here not to prove it, but\nto find out just how the law\ncomes to the aid of the business\nworld. The second proposition,\nhowever, is very generally overlooked. Legal specialists talk oc-\n\nwww.suspicions.com\n\ncasionally as if the sole deterrent\nfrom crime in the world today\nwere criminal law.1 Little wonder, then, that the layman looks\nto the law to accomplish singlehanded the greatest of wonders,\nand in turn criticizes the law for\nits failure to do that which he\ngratuitously assumes, in the first\nplace, it can do. When anything\ngoes wrong he says: There\nought to be a law against this or\nthat. He expects a legislative fiat\nto make men moral, to make men\nsober, to make men efficient. We\nmust, therefore, emphasize the\nlimits of effective legal action.2\nWhen it actually was necessary\nto look behind every tree for a\npossible Indian, the best code in\nthe world could not have done\naway with that necessity any\nmore than we can today put an\nend to war by such a simple device as declaring it unlawful. Yet\nwith the aid of law and a hundred other elements we have succeeded in reaching a measure of\ninternal peace and we may hope\nto achieve a corresponding measure of world peace eventually.\nThe point is that law does not\nand cannot work alone. The development of law is but a phase\nof the development of civilization. And when we speak of the\npart played by law in the satisfy-\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\n1. Law,\na Development of Civilization\nAs we go about our daily\nbusiness we take a great deal for\ngranted. If we had to look behind\nevery tree, figuratively or literally,\nfor a lurking Indian, we could\nhardly do the work of the modem\nworld. We assume a high degree\nof safety; we assume a high degree of human trustworthiness;\nwe assume that those about us\nwill act in a reasonable and fairly\npredictable manner; and the vast\nmajority of these assumptions\nare well founded. At least, we are\nnot often disappointed.\nIf we analyze these expectations or postulates on which\nmodern business is based, we\nfind very readily that they are\nsimple only to the simple\nminded. We discover that they\ndiffer not only in different times\nand places and among different\nraces of men, but that they are\nby no means all equally safe assumptions nor are they founded\non identical or even similar\nbases. In fact, the explanation of\neven the simplest and most obvious of these assumptions,\nupon analysis, becomes a hopelessly complex problem of the\nsocial and natural sciences. We\ntake it for granted, for example,\nthat a man can expose his wares\n\n7\n\n\fNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\ning of the postulates of business,\nwe must bear in mind that it does\nnot satisfy those postulates\nsingle-handed or exclusively. It\nis neither without allies nor without rivals.\n\n8\n\n2. Conditioning Forces\nNor is it without conditioning forces. Just as the business\nactivities of the world take for\ngranted certain conditions, including the cooperation of the\nlaw, the law itself has certain\npostulates. The current legal system assumes, for example, that\npeople take a certain amount of\ninitiative in turning the wheels\nof justice and, on the other hand,\nthat they will restrain themselves\njust so much from interfering\nwith this machinery. The system\nmust break down completely\nand does occasionally even in\nthis countrynot only where initiative is lacking because of indifference or fear, but also where\nmasked mobs, or the parties to\na feud, or even willful juries\ntake justice into their own\nhands. The law, furthermore, presupposes a certain degree of\nability to understand the lawit\nhas been found futile at several\nstages of history to transfer a\nhighly developed code to a crude\npeople. A law that penalized lying to the very limit would hardly\nwork in a community of confirmed liars. Our primary concern, however, is not with what\na system of law must take for\ngrantedthough we cannot ignore the bearing of this question\non the laws limitationsbut\nwith what business expects and\ndemands from the law.\n3. Limitations upon Law\nfor Business Ends\nFurthermore, we must recognize that other aspects of our\nlife, besides the business aspect,\nmake demands upon the law. In\nthe main, these demands are fortunately not only consistent with\nbut identical with the demands\n\nof the business world. Peace, fair\nand honest dealings, and the enforcement of obligations, for example, might be demanded in\nthe name of society, organized\non its political side, just as\nreadily as by that same society\nthought of as a business unit.\nThere are, of course, differences\nof emphasis, occasional differences in the limitations set, and\neven rare contradictions. Thus,\nbusiness if left to itself might\nnever have invented homestead\nexemptions as a limitation to enforcement laws. It is conceivable,\nbut not quite probable, that the\nenforcement of debts by means\nof imprisonment might have\nbeen abolished by the business\nworld as unprofitable in the long\nrun, without the aid of the\nhumanitarian considerations\nthat were perhaps uppermost in\nthe actual abolition of imprisonment for debt. So far, however,\nas we find conflicting demands\nmade upon the law in the name\nof human interests other than\nbusiness, we shall have to take\nthem into consideration as limitations upon the use of law for\nbusiness ends.\n4. Enumeration\nof Business Ends of Law\nWhat, then, are these business ends? Or, to resume the formal question with which we began, what does the business\nworld demand or more or less\nthoughtlessly expect of the law\ntoday? It has been demonstrated\nwith abundant learning by Dean\nPound that the end of law,\nviewed both practically and theoretically, has been developing\nthroughout the course of legal\nhistory.3 The earliest end discernible was a mere attempt to\nkeep the peace. In later states we\nencounter first the maintenance\nof an actual status quo and later\nthe struggle for some ideal set\nof relations known as equity or\njustice or natural fights. Today\nwe are stressing a fourth type of\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nwww.suspicions.info\n\nend, and emphasis is shifted to\nthe satisfaction of human wants\nand particularly to the opportunity for development.\nIt must be remembered, however, that in all of these developments the earlier ends of the law\nhave by no means been abandoned as the later ones have\nemerged. The maintenance of\npeace, the security of acquisitions, the approximation of what\nappears to society for the time\nbeing as natural justice or fairness, stand side by side today\nwith the insuring of human opportunities for development and\nadvancement. If we would restate\nthese general ends of the law\nmore narrowly in terms of what\nthe business world seeks, we\nshould still have to enumerate as\nmajor ends: (1) peace and effective enforcement; (2) security of\nacquisitions; (3) fair conditions\nin the market, and, in addition\nto these, (4) the facilitation of\ntransactions. Of course, the\nmeaning of all the older terms\nhas developed very materially as\ntime has gone on. The peace of\nthe Anglo-Saxon world, such as\nit was, would not suffice for the\nneeds of the modern business\nworld. Neither would the enforcement machinery of the Middle\nAges. The kinds of acquisitions\nthat may be deemed the subject\nof legal protection have multiplied and are changing even today. Some of the most important\ndevelopments of the law of recent years are concerned with\nthe growing concept of fair conditions in the market. But in the\nmain, it is true that the principal\naccomplishment of the last half\ncentury in the realm of business\nlaw has been the development of\nfacilities and positive opportunities for the specific transactions\nthat constitute business.\n5. Development\nof Ends of Law\nAll these accomplishments of\nthe law are so thoroughly and\n\n\f6. Business Postulates\nof Today\nFor the purpose of fitting\nthese postulates into the picture\nof business as it is conducted\ntoday, we might pursue the opposite order to that of their historical development and consider some characteristics of the\nneed today for (1) facilitation of\ntransactions, (2) fair market conditions, (3) security of acquisitions, and (4) effective enforcement and peace.\n(1) FACILITATION OF TRANSACTIONS. Typical of the transactions for which we expect the\n\nlaw to furnish ready frameworks\nare those transactions that have\nto do with the organization of the\nbusiness world. Business needs\nnot merely schemes for summarizing the relations existing between people within a particular\nbusiness enterprisesuch as\nagency, partnership, corporation, or Massachusetts trust\nbut also those devices that bring\ntogether cooperating parts of a\nbusiness, however separated\nthey may at first sight seem.\nThere is every gradation between\nthe hand-to-mouth buying of raw\nmaterials by one plant from another, through more comprehensive contracts for seasons and\nthrough leases, to the complete\ncontrol or even ownership of the\nplant furnishing the raw materials. Likewise, on the distributing\nside, a vast variety of relations\nmay exist between the producers and those engaged in the\nvarious steps of marketing. For\nall of these relations the law is\ncalled upon to furnish a fitting\nframework and under the pressure of American life the law is\njust as likely to be called upon\nfor mass production of frameworks of a more or less standardized nature as our factories are\nto give mass production of standardized machinery. Business\npresents numerous novel problems of organization calling for\nmost ingenious massing of traditional devices. Thus, where living conditions in a great city produce vast buildings in which it\nbecomes desirable to sell individual apartments to families,\nthe organization of the business\nside of the scheme may involve\nincorporation with more or less\ncomplicated adjustment of ratios\nof control, ownership, return,\nand risks which may not correspond exactly to the amount of\ninvestment. It may involve further peculiar types of leases or\ndeeds or mortgages. The financing may involve mortgages and\ntrusteeship and the issuance of\n\nwww.suspicions.com\n\nbonds or trust certificates in\ncombinations that had never\nbeen thought of before.\nThe credit devices of the\nmodern world must also respond\nvery delicately to peculiar needs\nin particular situations. There is\na constant problem, for example,\nto strike a balance somewhere\nbetween the safety of the loan\nand the freedom of the business\nto which the loan is made from\ninterference. In a general way,\nwhere real security is used the\nmore possessory a credit device\nis the simpler and safer it seems,\nbut at the same time the more\nlikely it is to interfere with the\nuse of things in the ordinary\ncourse of business. The vast series of new problems connected\nwith the financing of installment\nsales, of which the most prominent example, of course, has\nbeen automobile financing, will\nillustrate the type of call that is\nmade upon the law for new machinery or for new combinations\nof the old machinery of credit.4\nThere is, of course, a vast\nvariety of more or less typical\ntransactions that make up the\nbulk of everyday business. The\ntype of framework furnished for\nthem is perhaps best illustrated\nin our statutes standardizing\ncontracts of sale, the contracts\ninvolved in negotiable instruments, insurance contracts, employment contracts, and many\nothers, by stipulating what the\ndetails shall be either in the absence of contrary stipulation or\nany agreement to the contrary\nnotwithstanding.5 New varieties\nof transactions are constantly\nemerging for which new types of\ncontracts are required. Thus,\nwith the coming of new modes\nof transportation, whether we\nturn to the period of the introduction of the steam railroad or\nthat of the motor bus or that of\naviation, new types of receipts\nand agreements, with new\napportionments of risks, become\nrecognized as standard in the\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\nreadily taken for granted that it\nis somewhat difficult for us to\nrealize that, in the Anglo-American system of law, one need go\nback only a few hundred years\nto reach a period in which the\nkings courts were not interested\nin the private disputes of citizens\nso long as they did not affect the\nkings revenue or the kings\npeace. Of course, the allusion to\nthe kings revenue and the kings\npeace as the formal basis for taking jurisdiction over private disputes and enforcing private\nclaims was for a long time a mere\npretense, a fiction of the law. But\nthe fact that such a fiction had\nto be used at the beginning of\nmodem times should remind us\nthat, what we take for granted\ntoday when we expect this or\nthat of the law, was by no means\ntaken for granted at all stages in\nour legal history; that it is by no\nmeans taken for granted in all\nparts of the world today, at least\nin the same way; and that we\ncannot be sure that we have\nreached the limit of possible demands to be made upon law in\nthe furnishing of aids for the conduct of business. We are, in other\nwords, dealing with a situation\nthat is constantly developing,\nconstantly being experimented\nwith, and not at all with a preordained system of natural law.\n\n9\n\n\fNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\nlaw. In general, the tendency of\nbusiness is to require devices for\nthe facilitationand constantly\nfor the greater facilitationof a\nwidening circle of business activities. And the law responds,\nsometimes through the ingenuity of the lawyers in adapting and\ncombining the old legal devices,\nbut occasionally also, with the\naid of legislation, by the creation\nof new devices.\n\n10\n\n(2) FAIR MARKET CONDITIONS. The market conditions\nthat the business world demands\nof the law have undergone a complete transformation since the\ndays of Lord Coke. The picture\nof the buyer before the eyes of\nthe law has ceased to be that of\na very cautious, designing sort\nof person well able to take care\nof himself. On the contrary, every effort is made by means of\nthe licensing of dealers and\nmanufacturers, by means of the\nregistration and inspection of\nproducts, by blue sky laws, by\nimposing penalties for misbranding, adulteration, and\nfraudulent advertising, by safeguarding competition and condemning unfair methods of doing business, to make the market safe for purchasers. Let us\ncontrast the conditions in older\nsystems of law that looked rather\nto the protection of the seller. In\nRoman law, for example, there\ndeveloped the idea that a seller\ncould repudiate an extremely\nbad bargain though there was no\ncorresponding provision for a\ndisillusioned buyer.6 Such law\nwas, of course, appropriate in a\ncomparatively non-commercial\nsociety where the selling of\ngoods outside of the ordinary\ncourse of business was a sign of\ndistress on the part of the more\nor less unwilling and unfortunate\nowner. The buyer was looked\nupon as a wealthy person taking\nadvantage of the distress of his\nneighbor, much as if he were\nlending him money for usury.\n\nThis picture has changed completely. The buyer represents\ntoday the average member of\nsociety, while the seller is looked\nupon as the party better able to\ntake care of himself. The development of the modern point of\nview in recent times is illustrated\nin the development of the law of\nimplied warranties of quality7 or\nof title8 and the disappearance\nto that extent of caveat emptor.\nThe particular details as to\nwhich the public puts a buyer\nunder its protection are, of\ncourse, constantly changing.\nToday the danger is from misbranding, false advertising, inadequately described securities.\nYesterday the emphasis was\nrather on the danger of lack of\nskill in professional men, mechanics, and others who have\nbeen subjected to licensing laws.\nTomorrow the dangers may be\ndifferent and the emphasis may\nbe shifted to prevent the abuse\nof high-powered salesmanship\naccompanied by intriguing\ninstallment devices.\n(3) SECURITY OF ACQUISITIONS. The idea of security of\nacquisitions is, of course, one of\nthe most important and best developed in the law. It not only fills\nthe pages discussing real and\npersonal property, but it is the\nmotive behind much of the criminal law, the tort law, the family\nlaw and the constitutional law of\nthis country. In fact, the law is\nfrequently taunted with the\ncharge of setting property\nrights above human rights.\nWhat is really meant is the setting out more clearly of rights in\ntangible things than rights that\nseem to have less and less to do\nwith tangible things. Medieval\nlaw was so limited in its property\nconcepts that it could not conceive of transferring such in-corporeal rights as the power of appointment to a church office\nwithout some such act as handing over the knob of the church\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nwww.suspicions.info\n\ndoor. But as time has gone on,\nthe law has progressively overcome this dread of intangibles\nand within the field of business\nhas accorded the treatment formerly reserved for rights in\nphysical things to such new\ntypes of property as goodwill,\npatents, trade-marks, trade\nname, copyright, going-concern\nvalue, business reputation, interest in existing contracts, expectancies of various kinds and freedom of action. In addition, it has\ncurtailed the principle of property protection as formerly understood by developing another\ntype of interest, namely, the interest in security of transactions.\nWe shall find many instances in\nwhich a bona fide purchaser acting in the ordinary course of\nbusiness has his new acquisition\nprotected in preference to the\nolder owner who, though equally\ninnocent of wrong, has failed to\ntake the necessary steps to warn\nstrangers of the nature of his\nclaim. The varieties of business\ninterests calling for protections\nare infinite.\n(4) EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT\nAND PEACE. What has been said\nhere at some length regarding\nthe modern development of the\nold concept of security of acquisitions applies, mutatis mutandis, to the still older postulate of\npeace. This concept has grown\nto include a great deal more than\nthe official ending of disputes.\nThe machinery of enforcement\nincludes not only litigation but\nalso arbitration and conciliation,\nvarious preventive devices for\nanticipating both, and an increasing quantity of contractual\ncontrol over adjective law.9 The\nkind and degree of peace that are\nessential for commercial prosperity at this age are, of course,\nvastly different from that which\nenabled savage tribes to establish trading posts to which they\nwould alternately bring their\ngoods and from which each\n\n\fwould recede a safe distance\nwhile the other was present. But\nit also differs in smaller measure\nfrom the condition of commercial peace that was considered\nadequate in the pioneer days of\nthis country, when horse traders\ndid not feel thoroughly equipped\nfor their business transactions\nunless adequately armed. Nor is\nthe industrial peace of the early\ndays of unionism in this country,\nwhen strikes were notoriously\nlikely to be accompanied by violence, a fair picture of the business needs of these days of\nkeener competition, greater publicity, and more intense interest\nin industrial disputes on the part\nof the legislature.\nPerhaps the nature of the industrial and commercial peace of\ntoday may best be illustrated by\nreference to the exaltation of\ndue course to the level of a\nmajor principle by which transactions are to be judged. It is not\nonly, as already indicated, that\nthat which is done in due course\nis made to stand. The converse\n\nis equally true. It is on this basis\nthat a deviation from the simple,\nordinary course of business\ncomes to be condemned by the\nlaw. Thus, there was until recently nothing unlawful about a\npreferential payment of a debt by\nan insolvent. Business condemned the practice and now the\nNational Bankruptcy Act incorporates the business mans point\nof view. There was nothing illegal until recently in a tradesmans act of selling goods outside of the ordinary course of\nbusiness. The business conception of due course has, however,\nin spite of considerable resistance, been written into the bulk\nsales laws of many jurisdictions.\nMany acts that are coming to be\nrecognized as unfair methods of\ncompetition are, in the final\nanalysis, condemned because\nthey are contrary to the ordinary\nestablished course of doing\nthingsbreaches of the peace as\nthe modern business world formulates its requirements of commercial peace.\n\n1Cf.\n\nTrain, The Prisoner at the\nBar, 1907, Chapter 1.\n2\n\nCf.

DISHONEST MARKETING\n\n12\n\n1. Misrepresentations\nof Goods\nWhen the President of the\nUnited States made the now famous pronouncement, This proposal adds to the ancient doctrine of caveat emptor, the further doctrine, let the seller also\nbeware,1 was he setting a new\nforce in motion or was he simply\ntaking his place in a long line of\nlegal reformers bent on making\nthe market safe for the buyer? To\nanswer this question it is necessary only to enumerate the principles to which the overreached\nbuyer could resort before the\nNew Deal was written into the\nstatute books. In the first place,\nif the misrepresentation from\nwhich he suffered amounted to\nfraud- that is, if it was a misrepresentation of past or present fact,\nmade knowingly or with reckless\ndisregard of truth or falsity, under conditions where it tended\nto mislead and did mislead the\nvictim to his hurt the law\npounced down heavily upon the\nseller. He could in all probability\nbe prosecuted for one of the\n\ncrimes of which fraud is an ingredient: false labeling, false\nadvertising, obtaining goods\nunder false pretense, larceny by\ntrick, and so on. Again, he could\nbe sued for damages by the defrauded party and probably\nforced to pay smart money. The\ncontract itself could be set aside\nand, under appropriate decrees\nof a court of equity, the parties\nrestored to status quo. Or the\ncontract could be ignored as a\nnullity if that practice best served\nthe needs of the victim. Finally,\nthe defrauder might find himself\nface to face with the summary\nprocedure of some arm of preventive justice: a licensing commission ready to suspend his\ntrading license, an aroused inspector ready to impound or destroy or brand his goods, a publicity bureau ready to announce\nhis iniquity to the world.\n2. Breach of Warranty\nEven if the misrepresentation\ndid not technically amount to\nfraud, the lying vendor would not\nget off with impunity. Though he\nmay have innocently believed his\nown lie, he may have been guilty\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nwww.suspicions.info\n\nof a breach of an express warranty. An express warranty is\ndefined in the Uniform Sales Act\nas any affirmation of fact or any\npromise by the seller relating to\nthe goods... if the natural tendency of such affirmation or\npromise is to induce the buyer\nto purchase the goods.2 There\nare also implied warranties\nwhere nothing is said. The consequences of a breach of warranty, which is more easily\nproved in practice than is fraud,\nare, excepting for the penalties\nand quasi-penalties, the same as\nthose of fraud. The disappointed\nbuyer may keep the goods and\nsue for damages, or call the bargain off, or take other steps to\nrestore the status quo. Obviously\nthe law did not allow so much\nlying as the old by-word suggested.\n3. Reforms in Laws to\nPrevent Dishonesty\nNevertheless, there were and\nare possibilities of unpunished\ndishonesty in the market place,\nsome of which can be more effectively coped with as time goes\non. The reforms of the last gen-\n\n\ffor what he says or otherwise\nrepresents to be true under fraud\nand warranty laws that take him\nat his word. In addition, there are\nnumerous laws altogether preventing the sale of harmful\ndrugs, or at least putting dangerous ones subject to the requirement of a physicians prescription. There are, furthermore,\nstandards of purity established\nby authority, a comprehensive\nUnited States Pharmacopoeia.\nIt would be a mistake, however, to attribute all this change\nto the internal workings of the\nlaw. The impetus has come from\nmany sources, including educational campaigns conducted by\nmedical associations, magazine\npublishers, Better Business Bureaus, government departments.\nThe important point for our consideration is that the law of the\nmarket has been able to respond\nto the demand for a higher standard of honesty and has potentialities within it for still higher\nstandards, as society becomes\nready for them. The fraud formula must remain elastic.\nWhat has been said of the\nprevention of misrepresentation\napplies with little change to the\nprevention of other undesirable\nconditions and practices in the\nmarket: monopolistic conditions,\nunfair competition, incompetence, lack of responsibility, and\nin general one-sidedness or a\nloading of factors against the\nbuyer. Still, each of these tasks\nof the law has its own interesting peculiarities as well as historic accidents meriting separate\nattention.\nII. MONOPOLISTIC\nPRACTICES.\n1. Development\nof Anti-monopolistic Laws\nThe laws against monopoly\nare very old. In the Middle Ages\nthere were laws against forestalling, engrossing and regrat-\n\nwww.suspicions.com\n\ning, not to mention several subvarieties, the gist of which was\ninterference with the opportunities of the citizens of a town to\nget their needs provided for in\ntheir regular market. The injury\nresulting to one citizen from\nanothers simple trick of buying\nup the days supply of foodstuffs\non its way to town was a palpable\none, to be combated regardless\nof any theory of the function of\ncompetition in society.3 Actually,\nmedieval society did not rely on\ncompetition to set the right price\non all its goods and services. It\ndid not hesitate to name a just\nprice and a fair wage by decree.\nWhen we turn, however, to the\nlate nineteenth century revival of\ninterest in anti-monopoly laws,\nwe find a society permeated with\nthe notion that competition is in\nitself good, the very life of trade,\nand on the whole perhaps adequate for its effective regulation\nprovided that artificial interference with its workings is not tolerated. It is no part of the function of the law to propound or to\ncorrect economic theories, but it\nmust serve as the vehicle\nthrough which a society tries to\nput its theory into practice.\nSince the Sherman Anti-Trust\nAct was passed in 1890 there has\nbeen an increasing tendency to\nsupplement its workings by reliance on regulation, including\nprice fixing, notably but not exclusively in the fields of railroad\nand public utility law. In the National Industrial Recovery Act of\n1933, held unconstitutional on\nother grounds,4 there was even\na suspension of the workings of\nthe anti-trust laws in favor of\ndetailed regulation calculated to\nassure the public of the fair treatment that was the, primary objective of the anti-trust laws. With\na changing economic philosophy, or at least a changing degree of faith in the efficacy of\ncompetition, we may expect\nmore experimental legislation in\nthe direction of regulation. The\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\neration may be cited to indicate\nthe current tendencies. The most\noutstanding of these are: First,\na readier assumption by courts\nand juries that lies tend to mislead and do mislead. Second, a\nhost of statutes on phases of\nfraud covering such subjects as\nfalse labeling and advertising;\nthe plain marking of substitutes,\nimitations, artificial coloring or\nflavoring, the country of origin\nof goods; the publishing of the\nessential facts pertaining to securities offered for sale; presumptions and burdens of proof\nin certain cases, and a tightening of procedure and a stiffening of penalties in others. Third,\nthe intensive development of\npreventive measures against\nfraud, including licensing of persons, inspection of products,\npublicity, and the extra-judicial\nadministrative machinery that\ngoes with preventive justice.\nTo illustrate all of these tendencies we need only consider\nthe recent history of patent medicine advertising. One need not\nbe very old to remember when\nthe patent medicine man made\nunlimited claims for his concoctions of alcohol, herbs and flavoring matter. No one was expected to take him literally,\nwhether he barked about his\nelixir from the tail of his circus\nwagon or printed startling pictures labeled Before Taking and\nAfter Taking in the advertising\ncolumns of the rural magazine.\nHence, two essential elements of\nfraud were missing: the tendency\nto mislead and the actual misleading. The exaggerations were\nglossed over as dealers puffing.\nToday the vendor of patent medicines has to contend with a Federal Pure Foods and Drugs Act,\nquite likely to be strengthened,\na Federal Trade Commission,\nfraud orders of the Post Office\nDepartment, the scrutiny of the\nradio licensing authorities, the\nstate advertising laws, and direct\nresponsibility, criminal and civil,\n\n13\n\n\fwhole agitation for a planned\neconomy is based on this loss of\nfaith in the efficacy of competition as a planning force, a\nfaith which in the nineteenth century was rationalized by paralleling it with the theory of evolution.\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\n2. Innovations\nin Anti-trust Laws\nRemembering, then, that the\nSherman Act speaks in terms of\n1890, let us examine its innovations.\n\n14\n\n(1) CONTRACTS IN RESTRAINT OF TRADE. Contracts\nin restraint of trade were void\naccording to common law.\nWhether combinations in restraint of trade effected otherwise than by contractfor example, by means of trusteeship\nwere void was debatable, but we\nmay assume that even without\nthe aid of statute the law would\nhave reached them. Just how serious the restraint had to be in\norder to be obnoxious to the law\nwas debated anew with each case\nthat reached the courts. Here,\ntoo, we may assume a rule of reason would have developed without the aid of a statute. But to\ndeclare an arrangement void is\nto use only one of the sanctions\nof the law. It does not subject the\nperpetrators to a penalty, it does\nnot lay them open to an action\nfor damages at the instance of\nthose whom they have hurt, it\ndoes not provide for undoing\nwhat they have done. These sanctions were provided by the\nSherman Act.\n(2) PREVENTION OF MONOPOLISTIC PRACTICES. It was\nnot until 1914 that the modern\napproach of prevention was applied in the Federal anti-trust\nlaws. In that year not only did the\nClayton Act attempt to nip evil\nin the bud by prohibiting practices found likely to contribute\nto the upbuilding of monopolies,\n\nbut the Federal Trade Commission Act provided for the watchfulness of a commission with\nwide discretion to preserve the\nproper workings of the competitive system.\n(3) RULE OF REASON IN INTERPRETATION OF LAWS. The interpretation of the Federal antitrust act and of the state acts\nmodeled after it has led to a series of important Supreme Court\ndecisions that go beyond the\nmere verbal logic of ordinary\nstatutory interpretation. They\nhave worked out the principle\nthat it is the substance and not\nthe form that counts in determining whether a particular combination is illegal. Furthermore,\nthey have established the rule of\nreason, which, stripped of its\nverbiage, merely means that by\nno means every contract which\nrestrains trade or limits competition is obnoxious (for in a measure every contract does so), and\nthat the only standard which the\ncourt can read into the statute\nwithout arbitrariness is the general standard of reasonableness.\n(4) SUPPORT BY EVIDENCE.\nIn reviewing the findings of the\nFederal Trade Commission the\ncourt has generally felt unable to\nquestion its finding of fact because of the peculiar wording of\nthe statute which provides that\nsuch findings shall stand if supported by evidence. Had it said\nthe evidence, the court might\nhave been called upon to weigh\nthe evidence itself, but, as it is,\nthe only question before the\ncourt is whether there was any\nevidence to support the finding.\nIt would be a sorry case indeed\nif there were none at all.\nThe significance of this limitation on the courts is frequently\noverlooked by law writers as well\nas laymen in interpreting decisions under the Federal Trade\nCommission Act. Thus, in the\nfamous Beech-Nut case,5 which\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nwww.suspicions.info\n\ninvolved the systematic attempt\nof a manufacturer to thwart price\ncutters (the very aim that is now\nupheld by the Miller-Tydings Act6\nand similar legislation in most of\nour states7), the court had before\nit the finding of the Commission\nthat the manufacturer was guilty\nof participating in some kind of\na conspiracy in restraint of trade,\nand there was little for the court\nto do with that question of fact\nofficially settled.\n(5) UNFAIR METHOD OF\nCOMPETITION. Partly as a result\nof this control given to the Commission, but in part at least with\nthe encouragement of the court,\nthe term unfair method of competition, the subject of the prohibition of the important fifth\nsection of the Act, has come to\nbe looked upon rather paradoxically as the equivalent of undue\ninterference with competition. In\nother words, a clause which, by\nnecessary implication, recognizes the possibility that there\nmay be bad competition as well\nas good, becomes submerged in\nthe philosophy which upholds\ncompetition for its own sake. In\nthe Beech-Nut case, already alluded to, Mr. Justice Holmes is a\nvoice crying in the wilderness\nwhen he says that the practices\ncomplained of are neither unfair\nnor competitive. Thus, the\nphrase becomes a blanket authority for enumerating objectionable practicesobjectionable principally because they\ntend to foster monopoly and because they involve fraud upon\nthe publicand put them under\nan administrative ban.\nIt was partly owing to this\nconfusion of terms and the trade\npractice conferences that grew\nout of it, that the unfortunate\nNational Industrial Recovery Act\nproposed Codes of Fair Competition and that the term was\npromptly understood by administrators and business men as\nmeaning codes prescribing and\n\n\fproscribing practices with little\nor no thought of competition.\nEven the Supreme Court in the\nSchechter case 8 expressed\ndoubt, in the face of such practical interpretation, whether the\nmeaning of the phrase had any\nlogical connection with the\nmeanings of the words that composed it. Finally, to remove all\ndoubt, the language has been\namended in the Federal Trade\nCommission Act so as to include\nany unfair method of competition or unfair or deceptive act or\npractice in commerce.9 At the\nsame time, the scope of the act\nhas been broadened so as to include a good deal of false advertising regardless of whether injury to a competitor or even the\nexistence of a competitor can be\nshown. The new version of the\nAct, therefore, transcends the\nlimits of an anti-monopoly law.\n\n4. Extension of Unfair\nCompetition to Special Cases\nUnfair competition, in spite\nof the incidental and cavalier\ntreatment of it as part of the antitrust laws of the country, has a\nsignificance outside of those\nlaws. It is linked up with trademarks and trade names. In fact,\nwe may conveniently think of the\nterm as embracing infringements of trade-marks, trade\nnames, copyrights, patents, and\nother exclusive rights; palming\noff goods as those of an-other;\nand any other conduct that tends\nwithout legal justification to hurt\nthe business of a competitor. An\nofficial enumeration would have\nthe negative value of suggesting\nheretofore unimagined tricks,\nallowing to each, as to the common-law dog, at least one bite.\nThe basis on which the aggrieved\ncompetitor or customer or the\ngovernment or a commission\nmay institute a complaint or seek\nredress will differ widely in the\nabove cases which do not belong\nin any single legal category, however much they resemble each\nother in effect, and however\nmuch the courts and the lawmakers may desire to exclude\nthat effect from the market place.\nTo treat of all of them might get\n\nwww.suspicions.com\n\nus into such diverse pockets of\nthe law, as libel, in the case\nwhere one undertaker slyly sent\nhis competitors cards to the\nfamilies of sick persons, and corporation law, where deception is\ncarried out with the aid of a\nwholly owned subsidiary which\nparades as an independent corporation.\n(1) GENERAL ASPECTS OF\nUNFAIR COMPETITION RECOGNIZED BY LAW. For our purposes,\nit will be better at this point to\nconfine ourselves to those general aspects of unfair competition which the law recognizes,\nregardless of the means used,\nand add a few comments on the\npeculiarities of some of the more\nimportant situations. In general,\nthe law envisages unfair competition through the eye of the customer or the public, except in\nthose cases where an exclusive\nright has crystallized into a kind\nof property for the competitor,\nas in true trade-mark, copyright,\nor patent. Unless the public is\ndeceived or a specially protected\nright is involved, it is quite possible to annoy or even hurt a\ncompetitor without violating any\nlaw. Thus, my competitor may\ncopy with impunity my original\nplan for selling goods on credit,\nor my clever design for a garment, or my well-planned window display, or my combination\noffer, so long as he does not\nthereby mislead anyone into\nthinking that his customer is\ndealing with me. Some of these\nacts in competition appear quite\nunfair to the business man. He\nhas coined the phrase design\npiracy. He legislated against it\nin the NRA days and he has cooperated with trade associations\nand the Fashion Originators\nGuild of America to put it down.13\nWe may look forward to more\neffective protection of ideas in\nthe future, but the law of unfair\ncompetition as such still bears\nthe marks of its original aim- the\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\n3. Anti-competitive\nLegislation\nWhether because of a change\nof economic philosophy or because of the purely empirical discovery of harms flowing from unrestrained competition, there\nhave been engrafted on the antimonopolistic acts certain anticompetitive clauses generally\ndisguised for political reasons as\nanti-trust laws. Such disguise is\npossible because the competitors whose activities are curtailed\nare presumably large competitors on the way to becoming\nmonopolies. Most noteworthy of\nthese are the Robinson-Patman\namendment10 to the Clayton Act,\nand the fair practice acts culminating in the Miller-Tydings\nlaw.11 The former tends to prohibit the large retailer from utilizing some of his bargaining\npower in buying; the latter, to\nprohibit him from using his advantages in underselling his\nsmall competitor in certain protected classes of goods. Both\ntypes are at this stage limited\nexperiments calling for much\n\nadministrative implementing,\njudicial interpretation, the watching of loopholes and by-passes\nopen to aggressive competitors,\nand legislative amendment. The\nnew state and Federal laws requiring employers to submit to\ncollective bargaining with employees12 are also, so far as they\ngo, anti-competitive in their intent. Whatever social benefits\nmay be sought by anti-competitive legislationand there are\nmany- no law can save us from\npaying for these benefits\nthrough higher prices and a sacrifice of the advantages claimed\nfor intensive competition when\ntrust-busting was the order of\nthe day.\n\n15\n\n\fNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\nprotection of the interest of the\npublic.\n\n16\n\n(2) TRADE SYMBOLS. (a) Selling or Licensing of Trade Symbols to Others. Another consequence of looking at this branch\nof law through the eyes of the\npublic is manifest in the rule that\na trade-mark or trade name cannot be sold or licensed out in\ngross. That is to say, even if I\nhave created, popularized and\nconsequently own such a name\nas Ivory applied to soap or Red\nCross to mattresses, I cannot\nauthorize you to use the name\non similar products of yours with\nwhich I have no connection. Familiarity with the practice of licensing by patentees, or the authorization to reprint given by\ncopyright owners, has frequently\nmisled business men into the\ntrap of licensing others to use\ntheir trade symbols. But a trade\nsymbol is nothing but a shorthand way of telling the public of\nyour connection with the goods,\nand if you are not connected with\nthem, your licensing another to\nuse the symbol is merely authorizing him to tell a lie, and this\nthe law will not countenance.\nJust what connection must\none have with the goods to make\nan arrangement for the use of his\ntrade symbol on them proper?\nThe answer depends on another\nquestion, a shifting question of\nbusiness fact: What does the\ntrade symbol say to the ordinary\nmember of the public? A generation ago the judges were quite\nready with an approximate answer to this business question.\nThey said that a trade symbol\nindicated origin or ownership of\ngoods. Today a more careful answer is called for. There are, for\nexample, legitimate dealers\nmarks or even brokers marks, as\nwell as manufacturers, and they\nmay speak of care in selection,\nwillingness to warrant, uniformity of grade, or the possession\nof some quality suggested by the\n\nname or by an acquired meaning of the name under the force\nof usage and advertising. Once\nwe determine precisely what the\nsymbol says, we are able to answer our original question:\nwhether the proper facts are\nthere to justify a license or a\ntransfer of the right to use a\nname.\n(b) Preservation of Trade\nNames. The preservation of trade\nnames as ones own property\npresents a serious and at times\nan insuperable problem. Apparently one may lose his exclusive\nright to such invented words as\nescalator, listerine, vaseline, tabloid, mulsified, aspirin, and\nkodak, not merely by abandonment but through no fault of his\nown, if the public actually appropriates the word and makes it\nmean a class of articles regardless of who makes them.14\n(c) Registration of Trade\nNames. Registration of trade\nnames under state and Federal\nstatutes does not, in general,\nbestow rights. It merely makes\nclear the proof of the facts on\nwhich rights are based, and it\ngives notice to the world of these\nfacts from the date of registration. Such notice may, however,\nitself have the effect of a fact\nwhen we ask what territory is\npreempted by a particular use of\na name. In the absence of registration, it is possible to have the\nsame name developed simultaneously in several parts of the\ncountry or even in several cities\nin a single state. As a business\nexpands territorially, it becomes\nnecessary at times to draw\nboundary lines around the territory belonging to each user.15\nBut after a state registration, it\nis difficult to hold a new user in\nanother part of the state, or after a national registration, a new\nuser elsewhere in the nation,\nentirely without blame.\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nwww.suspicions.info\n\n(d) Boundaries of Articles\nCovered by Trade Symbols. An\neven more difficult problem concerns the boundaries around articles covered by a trade symbol.\nAgain, the publics view is the\ntest. Is the public likely to be\nmisled by the use of the word\nPhilco, well known in the radio\nbusiness, on safety razors?16 We\nmust keep in mind that this is a\nbusiness question and that the\nanswer is likely to change as\nmanufacturing and marketing\nhabits change. Courts have, it is\ntrue, attempted to list classes of\narticles such as foods, clothing,\nand machinery, to help them in\nsolving this problem, but such\nclasses are at best approximate\nand subject to change. And after they are made, the specific\nquestions are as fact-ridden as\never: are chewing gum and tobacco in the same sub-class; are\nsilk stockings and silk underwear; are shoes and hats?\n(e) Similarity of Trade Symbols. Looking at trade symbols\nthrough the public eye forces us\nto regard the offense of infringement as complete when there is\nsimilarity though not identity. If\ntwo boxes of cigars look enough\nalike to be mistaken for each\nother when not seen together, it\nis idle to bring experts to testify\nthat the types used in the printed\nmatter are of different fonts, or\nthe colors are distributed differently or the names spelled differently. The question is not whether\nan expert, setting the two boxes\ndown together in good light with\na ruler and magnifying glass, can\ndistinguish the counterfeit from\nthe genuine; it is, rather, whether\nthe transient cigar buyer in the\nsmoky atmosphere of the dimly\nlighted shop is likely to overlook\nthe difference.\n(f) Absence of a Technical\nTrade-mark. Furthermore, the\npublic can be deceived in the\nabsence of a true technical trade-\n\n\fmark or trade name, and the law\nshould protect it. It has long\nbeen laid down that one cannot\nmake a trade name out of a descriptive or geographic term, and\nthere are other limitations sometimes expressed by saying, You\ncannot appropriate any part of\nthe dictionary and exclude others from using it. Nor can you\nappropriate a color or number or\nordinary style of package as your\nown. And yet the law will not\npermit another to steal your\ngood-will by deliberately pretending to the public that his\nproduct is yours just because\nyou have neglected to perfect a\ntechnical trademark or trade\nname for yourself. Of course, you\nhave a more difficult case if you\nmust prove unfair competition\nwithout infringement of a trade\nsymbol. You will have to show\nlonger usage in order to convince\nthe court that color of wrapping\nor combination of ordinary descriptive and geographic words\nhas come to mark a product as\nyours. But it can be done, and\nthe possibility is the basis of a\nharvest of legal cases every year.\n\n(b) Similarity of Manufacturers Names. The most difficult\ncase of all arises where one\nwishes to use his own name for\na product that has previously\nbeen introduced by an-other of\nthe same name. Obviously there\nare three conflicting interests to\nbe adjusted. The prevailing interest is again that seen through\nthe eye of the public. One owns\nhis name, but he has no more\nright to use it to injure the public than he has to use his crowbar for such a purpose. Injunctions are frequently granted to\nprevent such misuse of ones\nown name. They should, however, be no broader than necessary to effectuate this proper\nend. Thus, it may be sufficient\nto demand a slight difference in\nthe set-up of the name, or a notice differentiating the producer\nof goods or the owner of a store\nfrom an established business\nbearing the same name; or it may\nbe necessary to demand a complete cessation of the use of the\nname. The courts will sometimes\nfeel their way. In the case where\na grocer named W. H. Baker lent\nhis name to a chocolate bar\ndressed up to imitate the bar\nlong sold by Walter Baker & Company, the court found it necessary, because of his persistence\n\nwww.suspicions.com\n\nin what seemed a deliberate attempt to benefit by the good-will\nof the old established house, to\nbroaden the injunction until it\nbecame unconditional.18 The\nfirst comer in such matters obviously has some advantages over\nlater comers, because his interest happens to coincide with that\nof the public.\nIII. LICENSING TO PREVENT\nINCOMPETENCE OR\nIRRESPONSIBILITY\nTo rid the market of incompetence, inefficiency, and irresponsibility, the chief resort of\nmodem law is to licensing. We\nare so accustomed to the requirement of licenses for all kinds of\nactivity from owning a dog to\ndriving an automobile, and particularly for the privilege of engaging in business or following\nprofessions, that it is hard to realize how recent a development\nwe are dealing with here. As late\nas 1883 Mr. Justice Field of the\nSupreme Court of the United\nStates declared that it was the\ndistinctive right of every American citizen to carry on the ordinary businesses of life without\nlet or hindrance.19 Even while he\nwas speaking, a development\nwas under way to require the licensing of physicians and lawyers, pharmacists and dentists.\nSoon the humbler callings of\nplumber and sewer tapper were\nincluded. By the end of the century, hundreds of cases had been\ndecided in the highest courts of\nthe several states and in the Supreme Court of the United States,\nupholding attempts to subject\npractically every known industry\nto the licensing power of the\nstate or its agencies. Many of\nthese licenses are perfunctory.\nThey are really petty privilege\ntaxes. Others are based on careful examinations, character studies and records.

The names of patented\narticles are in a different legal\nclass. An article worthy of a\npatent must be something new,\nand it is entitled to a new name.\nThe patentee gives it that name.\nWhen the patent expires, the\nwhole world has the right to\nmake the article and to call it by\nits name. Nice questions may\narise as to whether the name of\nthe patented article includes the\npatentees name. Can anyone\nmake a Singer Sewing Machine\nand sell it under that name? Or a\nStillson wrench? Obviously it may\nbe wise, during the life of a\npatent, to popularize not only the\nofficial name but a trade name\nor mark, as well, that can preserve for you such goodwill as\nyou have earned, for the time\nwhen the patent itself expires.\n\n(a) Expiration of Patent. A\ncurious instance of the combination of the principles of the\nlast two paragraphs is found in\nthe Shredded Wheat case.17 At\nthe expiration of the patent in\n1912, presumably anyone could\nhave made the product and\ncalled it Shredded Wheat. But\napparently no one did, and in the\ncourse of fifteen years the question arose whether beginning at\nscratch on the date of the expiration of the patent, the manufacturers had succeeded in putting into the words a secondary\nmeaning. The Supreme Court\nrecognized the possibility, but\nheld that it had not taken place.\n\n17\n\n\fNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\n18\n\nernment, which is inherent in the\nlicense system, still lies ahead of\nus. In the National Industrial Recovery Act, national licensing for\nall businesses was prescribed as\nan extreme measure.\nThe licensing power, however, does not in theory go so far\nas to authorize a state or national\nplanned economy. That issue was\nfought out in the case of New\nState Ice Company v. Liebmann.20\nThe State of Oklahoma had provided that no license be given to\nany ice company unless it had\nfirst procured from designated\nauthorities a certificate of public convenience and necessity.\nSuch certificates have in the past\nbeen required as conditions precedent to establishing new public utility enterprises, banks and\na few other types of business\ncharged with a public interest.\nThe Supreme Court held (Mr. Justice Brandeis dissenting) that in\nthe case of such an ordinary business as the manufacture of ice it\nwas not for the state to say how\nmany competing units were desirable. It is true, of course, that\nlicensing is sometimes perverted\ninto a means of keeping down\ncompetition in an industry or\nprofession. Those who are in,\neasily persuade themselves that\nstandards ought to be raised for\nnewcomers. Nevertheless, if this\nis the avowed motive of licensing, it is unconstitutional. If an\nofficially planned market becomes a desideratum, we must\neither amend the Constitution or\nresort to such subterfuges as\npurchasing compliance, after the\nmanner of the Agricultural\nAdjustment Act, 21 which was\nheld unconstitutional on other\ngrounds, and of the Bituminous\nCoal Act of 1937.22\n\n1\n\nFrom President Roosevelts\nmessage to Congress on Mar. 29,\n1933, recommending legislation\nfor Federal supervision of traffic in\ninvestment securities in interstate\ncommerce.\n2\n\nSec. 12 of the Uniform Sales\nAct, p. 297.\n3\n\nE.

THE USE OF CONTRACTS\n\n20\n\nFor the successful conduct of\nbusiness it is not enough to police the market-place and rid it\nof the dangers discussed in the\nlast chapter. It is necessary also\nto provide reasonable facilities\nfor its work, and among these\nnot the least important are facilitating laws. The greatest part\nof this service is rendered by the\nlaw of Contracts, legally recognized and enforceable agreements. Contracts are involved in\nevery sale of goods or lands, or\nother valuables such as securities or goodwill, in every lease,\nin every extension of credit, in\nevery act of employment, in arranging for such services as the\ncarriage of goods and passengers, in using the communication facilities furnished by the\nmails or the telephone and telegraph companiesin fact, wherever money is used, and in some\ntransactions even where it is not\nused. A study of contracts would\nthus overlap, besides market facilities, a great many other parts\nof our study, such as Credit and\nOrganization in business, and\nsome domestic and property ar-\n\nrangements scattered through\nother volumes of this work. A\ngeneral treatment of the principles of contract law is accordingly presented elsewhere (Volume VI). At this stage we are concerned, rather, with some specific contracts in common use in\nbusiness than with principles\ncommon to all contracts.\n1. Development\nof the Law of Contracts\nIt appears, then, that the\nwarp and woof of modem business is contractual. It was not\nalways so. We can picture places\nin the old world where the external appearances of life have not\nchanged materially since the late\nMiddle Ages. The man we now\nsee working in the field is completely enmeshed in contracts.\nHe is a tenant by virtue of a contract, or is employed by contract.\nIn turn, he employs others in the\nsame way. He sells his produce\nby contracts and acquires what\nhe needs in like manner. Yet his\nancestor, who did the same kind\nof work and lived a similar life,\nwas scarcely touched by contract\nlaw. He was born into a status\nunder the feudal system, and by\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nwww.suspicions.info\n\nreason of that status had certain\nrights and duties in his relations\nto those above him and those\nassociated with him or below him\nin the social-economic-political\nstructure of his time to which we\nhave given the name feudalism.\nIf we ask why and how this great\nchange has come about, we shall\nfind the answer in a whole literature, the nucleus of which will be\nfound in a famous sentence\npenned by Sir Henry Maine in\n1861: The movement of the\nprogressive societies has hitherto been a movement from Status to Contract.1 Nineteenth\ncentury writers attributed a good\ndeal of significance to this formula. They saw freedom in the\ncontract principle which said that\nno man (in the absence of fault)\nshould be held to owe duties to\nhis fellow men unless he had\nvoluntarily undertaken them.\nThe status theory of duties suggested serfdom or slavery, which\nhad been abolished in Great Britain and its possessions earlier in\nthe century and was soon to disappear in America and Russia\nand throughout the civilized\nworld.\n\n\f2. Freedom of Contract\nIn this country the doctrine\ngrew to be a dogma of constitutional law, though it is not\nwritten into the Constitution of\nthe United States: the dogma of\nfreedom of contract. Under it, at\nthe end of the nineteenth century and in the first years of the\ntwentieth century, a good many\nlegislative efforts to dictate the\nterms of contracts were\nthwarted. Not only were statutes\nwith reference to the labor contract thrown out unless clearly\nwithin the police power of the\nstate, but price regulation and\nthe exclusion of unfair terms in\ntypes of contracts that had come\nto be one-sided were deemed\nimpossible. The only exception\nof importance was that public\nutilities (including carriers) were\nsubject to such control as to\nmake them duty bound not only\nto contract with all members of\nthe public without discrimination, but to treat them all fairly,\nand the authorities were beginning to interpret this to mean\nthat the rates and other terms\ncould be fixed by legislative or\nproperly authorized administrative action.\n\n4. Advantages of\nStandardized Contracts\nAs other contracts have been\nstandardized and still more are\nbeing standardized in the same\nwaynotably, bills of lading,\nwarehouse receipts, sales of\ngoods, sales of securities, real\nestate transactions, and bankingit will be worth our while to\nconsider the workings of the laws\nto standardize insurance agreements. In the first place, the\nelimination of specialized phrasing has greatly decreased litigation over the meaning of terms.\nAll of the standard phrases have\nbeen judicially defined. The provisions are reasonably two-sided.\nIt is possible to buy insurance\nquickly and, at least in ordinary\ncases, without expensive expert\nadvice including legal advice.\nFurthermore, it is possible to\ncover parts of the same hazard\nin different companies without\nsowing a wind and reaping a\nwhirlwind of confusion. It is possible to master, once for all, the\nessentials of each type of contract, as it was impossible to\ncarry in mind a clear picture of\nwhat each individualized contract covered or failed to cover\nin the past. The companies benefit almost as much as their customers. Whatever competition\nthey maintain, they are not\nforced to weigh in the balance\nnon-comparable clauses. So a\n\nwww.suspicions.com\n\ngreat deal of sales resistance has\ndisappeared. Peculiar insurance\ncontracts are still possible to\nmeet peculiar situations, but the\nadvantages of the standardized\npolicies are such that they have\ncome to prevail almost as generally as they would had the legislature been empowered to say\nany contract to the contrary notwithstanding, and had it been\nso minded.\n5. Disadvantages of\nStandardized Contracts\nThe advantages of standardizing contracts are not unlike\nthose of standardizing machinery, and the government may\nplay a similar part in both processes. There are, on the other\nhand, the same kinds of disadvantages. The standard gauge of\nmachine or cut of clothing that\nserves the average case best\nmay not serve any actual case\nso well as the made-to-measure\narticle would. So, we shall see,\nthe standardized contract of\nsale fits many modern situations\nrather poorly. Furthermore,\nstandardization makes change\nto meet new conditions rather\ndifficult. The standard gauge of\nrailroad tracks is said to be\nbased, in the last analysis, on\nthe strength of a horse. No matter how powerful engines can be\nmade in the foreseeable future,\nit is difficult to see a change in\nthis gauge as long as trains run\non tracks. In like manner, a standardized contract for any given\npurpose, whether it be insurance, banking, or the sale of\nclothing, is likely to resist adjustment to the changing needs\nof a dynamic society. We shall\nfind ample illustrations in the\nmost important standard contract of the market, that established in the Uniform Sales Act,\nor in the common law of Sales\nof the last century which it faithfully codifies.\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\n3. In Absence of\nAgreement to Contrary\nA practical compromise was\npossible about the turn of the\ncentury, when the theory of freedom of contract was at its height.\nHowever chary a legislature had\nto be in using the phrase any\ncontract to the contrary notwithstanding, it could readily say in\nthe absence of any agreement or\ncontract to the contrary, and lay\ndown the whole or the essential\npart of a standardized contract\nto fit any given situation. It was\nin this way that the State of New\nYork, after an important study of\ninsurance companies, wrote into\nits statute books a series of standard insurance policies which\nwere to cover all cases in this\nabsence of written agreements to\n\nthe contrary. Only a few provisions were put beyond the control of the parties, and these were\npresumably justified under the\npolice power- that somewhat\nvague power of the states to protect public health, safety and\nmorals. Many other states followed the example of New York.\nEventually, standardized insurance policies took the place of\nthe widely varying, somewhat\ntreacherous, one-sided documents that had become a scandal under the regime of freedom\nof contract.\n\n21\n\n\fNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\nII. UNIFORM SALES LAW\n\n22\n\n1. Standardized Contract of\nthe Uniform Sales Act\nA sale may be defined, for our\npurposes, as the transfer of ownership of goods for a consideration called a price. So definedother definitions are also possibleit is not a contract; it is\nmerely a step in the performance\nof a contract of sale. The contract\nmay call for an immediate performance or a future performance. It is also possible that,\nfor one reason or another, such\nas delay in completing the\ngoods, the performance takes\nplace after the time agreed upon.\nWe are for the moment concerned with the contract rather\nthan with the nature of ownership and its legal consequences.\nThere are, or may be, other details in the performance of the\nseller than a recognition of the\nthing as yours and no longer his,\nfrom a given moment. He must\nat least surrender possession,\nand probably also the title or\nindicia of ownership, and he may\nbe bound by the contract to\npackage, condition, transport,\nset up, or service the thing sold;\nhe may be bound to defend your\nclaim to it against all comers or\nonly certain comers; he may be\nbound to make good certain or\nall defects and pay damages for\nlosses resulting from defects, or\ntake the goods back or stand\nbehind them in other ways. He\nmay have bound himself to give\nup possession without being\npaid and wait a stated time for\nhis money. He may have agreed\nto insure the goods, to make\nproper arrangements on your\nbehalf with a carrier for their\ntransportation. He may have\nbound himself to keep spare\nparts on hand and to supply\nthem to you at reasonable rates;\nlikewise, to carry in stock\nimprovements and gadgets that\nmay be added, from time to time,\nto the article sold by the manu-\n\nfacturer. He may have agreed to\ntake the article back under certain conditions and pay back or\nallow in trade parts of the price\naccording to a schedule. Perhaps\nhe has agreed not to sell goods\nof the same pattern to your competitors. It is, of course, impossible to exhaust the list of\nauxiliary promises that may be\nmade by a seller in connection\nwith his promise to transfer the\ntitle and possession of his goods.\nSimilar promises can be made\nby the buyer in addition to the\nprimary undertaking to pay for\nthe goods. Though it is not likely\nthat a great many of the stipulations enumerated above exist together in any ordinary contract,\nit is even more unlikely that, in\nthe ordinary course of business,\nwe shall come across a sale in\nwhich none of them accompany\nthe transfer of title. Hence, it is\nbetter, for purposes of analysis,\nto follow the English version of\nthe Sales of Goods Act, which recognizes a Contract of Sale in every case, than the American version, which speaks of a Contract\nfor the Sale of Goods if the transfer of ownership is postponed,\nand a Sale (with no allusion to any\ncontract) if the transfer of ownership is immediate.\n2. Special Stipulations in\nIndividual Contracts of Sale\nIf all of the terms of every\ncontract of sale had to be mentioned, to say nothing of a requirement of writing, the ordinary haberdashers clerk could\nperhaps, with the aid of a lawyer, sell a single collar or tie in a\nday, and at the end of the day he\nwould be completely exhausted.\nWith standardization, he blandly\nwraps up package after package\nwhile chatting about the\nweather, and lets the law dictate\nthe terms as to what may and\nwhat may not be expected of the\ngoods. But on what principle\ndoes the existing Sales Law make\nits selection among all the pos-\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nwww.suspicions.info\n\nsible contracts that the parties\ncould conceivably make were\nthey minded to write special\nstipulations?\nTo answer this question we\nmust bear in mind the type of\nsale that was most common in\nEngland while this law was in its\nformative stage, a century ago,\nrather than the type of sale with\nwhich we are today familiar in the\nlarge stores m urban centers.\nThus, the sale presumed is a\ncash-and-carry transaction; it is,\nin the absence of the proof of a\ncontrary intent, the task of the\nbuyer to pick up the goods as\nthey are at the sellers place of\nbusiness or home or wherever\nthey may be, and carry them\naway. From this presumption\narose the complicated result that\nthe carrier is generally to be considered the agent of the buyer in\ngetting the goods, rather than of\nthe seller in carrying them.\nHence, claims against the railroad company are normally made\nby the consignee; hence, also,\nthe goods in the hands of the\ncarrier, even if they are being\nsent C.O.D., are looked upon as\nalready in the possession of the\nbuyer. And since liens are based\non possession, it is too late to\nenforce a lien, strictly speaking,\nif the goods are in transit, even\nthough at that stage it is discovered that the buyer is insolvent.\nFor this reason there has grown\nup a very technical doctrine of\nstoppage in transitu, to restore\nthe goods to a position in which\na lien or its equivalent can once\nmore be asserted by the seller.\nFurthermore, as there is no presumption that credit is to be extended, the seller is entitled to\nhold the goods until there is a\ntender of payment, in the absence of specifications to the\ncontrary. Out of this notion\ngrows the vendors lien.\n3. Implied Warranties\n(1) ABSENCE OF PROVISION\nFOR THE MIDDLEMAN. Another\n\n\ffeature of the type of sale contemplated which reflects the past\nrather than the present is the\nabsence of provision for the\nmiddleman. Practically all of the\nwarranties recited as implied\nassume that the only buyer contemplated is a consumer, and the\nsellers are dealt with as growers\nor manufacturers, whether they\nbe growers or manufacturers or\nnot.2 Warranties do not run with\nthe goodsthat is to say, even\nif branded goods are bought\nfrom a middleman who obviously\nhas nothing to do with their\npreparation, the buyer must look\nto him for any warranties, and he\nin turn may or may not have recourse to the manufacturer. The\nlaw has, it is true, done something to meet this condition, but\nnot within the Sales Act nor under the heading of warranties.\nThe disappointed buyer may\nmake his claim against the negligent manufacturer, if at all, only\non the ground that it was a tort\nto send poisonous or otherwise\ndangerous goods out into the\nworld without proper warnings.\n\n4. Rules Vesting\nTitle in the Buyer\nThe type of sale contemplated, furthermore, is the sale\nof goods ready for transfer over\nthe counter, in which case the\nsale is consummated when the\ncontract is made.\nHence, on the question when\ntitle passes, after stating that it\nall depends upon the contract\nwhich, in turn, is the intent of the\nparties, to be gathered from the\nwords, surrounding circumstances, customs, and other relevant evidencethe Act proceeds to lay down a series of\nrules to be. resorted to in extreme cases of doubt, and these\nrules favor the earliest possible\nvesting of title in the buyer. Thus,\nthe first of them assumes this\nextreme and rather surprising\nform: Where there is an unconditional contract to sell specific\ngoods, in a deliverable state, the\nproperty in the goods passes to\nthe buyer when the contract is\nmade, and it is immaterial\nwhether the time of payment, or.\nthe time of delivery, or both, be\npostponed. 3 Literally interpreted, this would mean that if\nA sold his automobile to B on\nJanuary 1st, to be delivered and\npaid for on February 1st, B might\nexpect a telephone call any time\nduring the month of January in-\n\nwww.suspicions.com\n\nforming him that his automobile\n(that is, Bs) had been stolen or\ndestroyed, and that he could take\nwhatever steps were still open to\nprotect his interests, but that A\nwould still have to be paid at the\ntime agreed upon. This, of\ncourse, would seem like arrant\nnonsense to B. All that the rule\nand those that follow it mean is\nthat where the case permits of\nsuch an interpretation at all,\nearly vesting of title in the purchaser is to be preferred to later\npossible dates.\n5. Deviations from the Sales\nActSpecial Sales Agreements\nIn view of the inadequacy of\nthe simple picture of sales that\nis taken from the life of a century or two centuries ago, it frequently becomes necessary to\ndraw up special sales agreements, or at least stipulations, to\ncover phases of the sales contract for particular purposes. A\ncomparison of the sales form\nused by a large corporation with\nits order form will indicate at\nonce the latitude possible in\nmaking deviations from the Sales\nAct. The tendency of the sales\nform is to shift every possible\nrisk to the buyer. The tendency\nof the order form is the opposite,\nand in addition it is likely to\nspecify warranties of a technical\ntype, such as the one against\npatent infringement, and to deviate markedly from the assumptions of the Sales Act by covering credit terms, plans for packing and delivery, opportunities\nfor inspection and even devices\nfor self-help in case of disappointment on the part of the\nbuyer.4 On the other hand, it is\nnot unusual for both buyer and\nseller to favor a deviation from\nthe law which refuses to excuse\na man from his contractual\nobligation in the face of hardships not of his own making. A\nstipulation making an order or a\npromise to sell subject to strikes,\nlockouts, fires or other unavoid-\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\n(2) WARRANTIES APPLICABLE TO CONSUMER-PURCHASER. An examination of the\ndetails of the implied warranties\nwill bear out the picture of (a) the\nconsumer-purchaser dealing\nwith a manufacturing dealer,\nrather than (b) of a dealer-purchaser or manufacturing-purchaser. The first implied warranty\nis that, where there is reliance on\nthe judgment of the seller that\nthe goods are fit for the buyers\npurpose, there is an implied warranty that the goods are fit for\nsuch a purpose. Another warranty is that, when one buys\ngoods from a dealer the goods\nare of merchantable qualityand\nmerchantable, though it might\noriginally have meant fit to be\nresold, has, since the Sales Act\nwas adopted, been pretty definitely interpreted to mean merely\nstandard quality.\n\n(3) USE OF TRADE NAME\nAND WARRANTY. Where goods\nare bought by their patent or\nother trade name there is no\nwarranty that they are fit for any\npurpose. On the other hand,\npatent or trade names are coming definitely to have secondary\nmeanings, as a result of the advertising that goes into them,\nand it is reasonable to read into\nthe use of the name a warranty\nthat the goods have all the qualities or ingredients for which that\nname has come to be an abbreviated method of statement.

SPECIALLY REGULATED\nCONTRACTS\n\n24\n\nAlthough current law regards\nmost of the other services rendered in business as fitting into\nthe frame of contract, it has become necessary to recognize and\nregulate certain peculiar features\nof these relations, so that we may\nagain look upon many of them\nas they were looked upon in\nBlack-stones day when they were\nmore standardized. Of course,\nthe details of the standardization\nof the twentieth century differ\nfrom those of the eighteenth.\nThus, it is possible to view the\nduties of the carrier both of persons and of goods, the duties of\nthe insurance company and certain public utilities, of banks and\ntrust companies, commodity and\nsecurity exchanges, public warehousemen and many others engaged in dealing with the public, as dictated only in part by\ncontract and in large measure by\nrules of law, some of which are\nset down in the absence of any\ncontract to the contrary, and others, any contract to the contrary\nnotwithstanding. Even where it\nis legally possible to deviate, it\nmay be difficult if not impossible\nin practice to substitute ones\nown terminology: hence such\nrules are, in effect, a return to\nstatus. We may select, from this\nlist of special services, twothat\nof the insurer and that of the\npublic utilityto illustrate\nphases of their development pertinent to the study of other typical business services.\n1. Substantive Law of\nInsurance\nThe essence of an insurance\ncontract is an agreement\nwhereby the insurer agrees to\nreimburse the insured for a loss.\nThe insurer may, of course, be a\n\ngroup of persons including the\ninsured, and the total significance of the contract may be to\nspread the loss over the whole\ngroup instead of leaving it on the\nshoulders of the individual upon\nwhom it falls. On the other hand,\nthe insurer may be a group of\nunderwriters or a corporation\nthat entered into the business on\na purely commercial basis. By\ncarefully calculating the probabilities of loss over a widespread field, the insurer can reimburse itself through the collection of a premium which is a\nsmall percentage of the risk covered in any particular case. These\nterms apply pretty clearly to\nmarine insurance, in which the\nwhole plan probably originated.\nThey are almost equally applicable to fire, accident, theft, tornado and even credit insurance.\nSome stretching may be necessary in order to make them apply to life insurance, for life insurance has two phases: though\nthe time of death is uncertain,\nits eventual occurrence is certain.\nHence, life insurance involves the\nbuilding up of an estate which\nwill eventually be paid over, as\nwell as the covering of the risk\nof premature death before the\nestate is built up. The estatebuilding side is, therefore, somewhat akin to the function of a\nsavings bank. Its difference is\nthat, instead of holding various\nsums calculated individually for\neach depositor, the insurance\ncompany holds a lump sum, in\nwhich all of its depositors have\nan interest, to be partitioned\namong the individuals in accordance with unforeseeable events.\n(1) CONTRACTS\nOVER\nWEIGHTED AGAINST THE CUSTOMER. During the days of freedom of contract, insurance\ncompanies had a tendency to\nwrite their own lengthy and\ncomplicated agreements giving\nthe customer little or no option\nbut to sign on the dotted line. In\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nwww.suspicions.info\n\ncourse of time, the tendency was\nto make policies so one-sided\nthat an insurance company\ncould, if it cared to, dodge or at\nleast question its liability. Thus,\nevery statement made in the\ncourse of buying a policy was put\ndown as a warranty, so that if\nthere was any deviation from the\ntruth, all of the rights of the insured could be defeated. Other\nspecial defenses, including special periods of limitation and special modes of proof of loss, were\nmultiplied. This tendency to\nwrite drastic contracts weighted\nagainst the customer is by no\nmeans limited to the business of\ninsurance. It has occurred in the\nhistory of bills of lading and\nmany other fundamental contracts on which important businesses are based. Eventually in\nsuch cases the courts and the\nlegislatures step in to protect the\ncustomer. In the case of the insurance companies, legislation\nhas produced in most of our\nstates a standard series of policies, and litigation has developed\na principle of interpreting all\ndoubtful phrases most strictly\nagainst the insurance company.\n(2) WEEDING OUT OF IRRESPONSIBLE INSURANCE COMPANIES. Another phase of public\ninterest in the insurance company has as its objective the\nweeding out of irresponsible\ncompanies and the prevention of\npractices likely to impair solvency. Under the laws of most\nstates, insurance commissioners\nare appointed who exercise a\nbroad discretion in the matter of\ngranting licenses to engage in\nthe business of insurance. Many\nof these laws are supplemented\nby the requirement of a minimum\ncapital and a deposit of securities with state officials for the\nprotection of interests of citizens. Furthermore, there is exercised control over the investment policy of insurance companies. Constant inspection is pro-\n\n\fvided for, and liquidation by a\npublic officer is compulsory\nwhere an insurance company has\nfailed to maintain the margin of\nsafety required by law.\n\n(1) MAKING OF RATES. The\ncentral interest of the state is in\nrates, and a great deal of law has\ngrown up governing the making\nof rates. Theoretically, the object\nof this legislation is to give the\ncitizens fair rates; actually, however, the only possible basis on\nwhich utilities have been able to\nfight rates which they considered\ninadequately remunerative has\nbeen to allege in court that their\nconstitutional rights are jeopardized by a rate which operates\nto confiscate their property without due process of law. Hence,\nthe eyes of the law have been\n\n(a) Fairness of Particular\nRates. The two distinct questions\nhave been rather crudely related\nin the procedure before commissions by using the formula of\nvaluation for the property devoted to the public utility, in order to find a rate base, and from\nthis rate base to proceed through\nthe mathematics of a fair return\nto the answer m a rate schedule\nor a particular rate. Actually there\nare too many unknown quantities in this calculation from beginning to end to make it anything more than a check against\ncareless guessing or arbitrariness. It is quite possible, for example, that the value of a plant\nhas no direct relationship to the\nvalue of the service that it renders. A cheap taxicab might give\nthe same service on a particular\noccasion as a more expensive\none. In either case it may be\nworth fifty cents to be carried\nfrom the hotel to the station.\n(b) Remuneration to the Investors. Furthermore, there may\nbe a socially desirable rate which\ndoes not pay or which overpays\nthe investor. Thus, there may be\nvery good reasons why New York\nCity should want to hold subway\nfares down to five cents, and\nthose reasons may be so potent\nthat it may be wise to have the\ncitizens make up deficits out of\ntaxes. The assumption that the\nrate which gives a normal return\nto investors is at the same time\nboth a socially desirable rate and\na rate that gauges the actual\nvalue of the service, is a wholly\ngratuitous assumption.\n(2) FACTORS WHICH CONSTITUTE A PROPER RATE BASE.\nNevertheless, a vast part of pub-\n\nwww.suspicions.com\n\nlic utility law is devoted to refinements of the question: what constitutes a proper rate base. Is it\noriginal cost modified by depreciation, appreciation, depletion,\nobsolescence and such accounting considerations? Is it the\npresent cost of reproduction,\nmodified by this and similar considerations? Is it the prudent and\ndefensible portion of actual investment that we should start\nwith? Is it present valuation arrived at by appraisal independently of all these elements?\nShould earning capacity be taken\ninto consideration? Is goodwill in\nany sense a possession of the\ninvestors in the utility? How shall\nfranchises be valued? Though\nthere is much technical learning\nput forward on all of these questions, most of it is rendered\nnugatory in effect by a very\nsimple device on the part of commissions: whenever the finding\nof a commission is set aside because of its failure to take any\none of these elements into consideration, it proceeds thereafter\nto make a point of listening to\nthat type of evidence and proclaiming that it does take that\nelement into consideration. An\naward of a commission which\nproclaims that it has taken everything into consideration is, if\nat all within the range of reason,\nproof against court attack.\n\n1\n\nAncient Law, p. 168-170.\n\n2\n\nUniform Sales Act, Secs. 1316. p. 298.\n3\n\nSec. 19, Rule 1, p. 300.\n\n4\n\nL.B.P., pp. 196-198.\n\n5\n\nFor an outstanding work on\nthis subject see Bonbright, James\nC., The Valuation of Property,\nNew York, 1937.\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\n2. Public Utilities\nStill, an insurance company\nis not a public utility. It is not, in\ngeneral, required to do business\nwith anyone whom it considers\na bad risk. The public utility must\ntreat all comers alike. The insurance company generally requires\nno franchise in the sense of a\nspecial privilege in the use of\npublic property. Most of our public utilities, such as water works,\ntelephone and telegraph companies, gas and electric companies\nand street railway companies, are\ndependent on such franchises,\nand, in accepting, them are\nbound to assume special contractual relations with the state\nor city. In fact, the public utility\nhas practically no freedom of\ncontract. The telephone company must render service to all\npersons alike. The schedule of its\nrates is that which is dictated or\nat least approved by a commission. Its so-called contract is likewise a set of terms laid down for\nall persons subject to such\ncommissions approval. Hence,\nthe law of public utilities is very\nlargely the administrative law of\nthe several states.\n\nturned from the question of the\nfairness of particular rates to the\nentirely distinct question of the\ntotal remuneration of the persons who have invested in the\nutility.\n\n25\n\n\fChapter IV\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\nSecurity of Transactions\n\n26\n\n1. Insecurity of Transactions\nafter Completion\n(1) ILLEGAL SELLING OF\nANOTHERS PROPERTY. Business\ninvolves so many risks, that it is\nreasonable for the business man\nto favor the removal of those\nwithin the control of the law. One\nof these is the insecurity of transactions after they have been completed. Legal tradition tends to\nprotect property rather than\ntransactions. The two ideals frequently clash. Thus, an unauthorized person sells the goods of\none innocent man to another.\nThe trickster has disappeared\nwith the purchase money. As\nmatters stand, one of two innocent persons must suffer. The\nfirst proposition that confronts\nus is that the goods still belong\nto the original owner. He has\ndone nothing to authorize their\nsale, nor has he misled the innocent buyer. Of course, if he has,\nwe may find refuge in another\nmaxim: where one of two innocent persons must suffer, let\nit be that one who has put the\nfraudulent party in a position to\ndefraud. But even that maxim is\na concession to the business\nmans point of view. In strict law,\nthe ownership of the goods has\nnot changed hands.\n\n(2) CAVEAT EMPTOR. The\nold rule that throws the major\nrisk on the buyer is a hindrance\nto business. The investigation it\ncalls for slows up the process of\nnegotiating and selling. The\ndoubt that remains after the\nmost complete investigation is a\nsource of sales resistance. When\nthe adverse claimant comes out\nof his hiding place, the seller in\nthe market, who may himself be\ninnocent, must make good his\ncustomers loss. Caveat emptor\nin this sense, the only meaning\nin which it approximately reflects\nthe law, is not a popular doctrine\nwith business men. The general\nrule of the common law, we are\ntold, is that every man dealing\nwith another in reference to\nproperty that other may have in\nhis possession, must take care,\ncaveat emptor. The property may\nbe stolen, or borrowed, or\npledged, or in the possession of\na bailee for some specific purpose, and if so, the party in possession can convey no better or\nfurther right than he has himself.1 The owner of a thing or of\nany interest in the thing could,\naccording to this theory, follow\nit wherever it was taken and\nclaim it against the holder for the\ntime being, regardless of the conditions under which he had got-\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nwww.suspicions.info\n\nten it, regardless of the hardship\nthereby inflicted. A purchaser\ncould acquire no greater rights\nthan his vendor possessed. This\ndogma was put forward as a kind\nof law of nature, and Latin was\ninvoked against those who questioned it. Nemo plus juris ad\nalienum transferre potest quam\nipse habet.2 In fact, even after\nthe innocent stranger had parted\nwith the tainted property, the\nowner could complain of the conversion and sue him in tort.3 It\nwas worse than the Imp in the\nBottle. Let us examine in some\ndetail the process by which the\nlaw eventually destroyed the barrier to every business transaction\nimplied in these ancient theories.\n(3) LIMITATION ON RIGHTS\nAND POWERS OF OWNER OVER\nINNOCENT POSSESSOR. The earliest limitations on the rights and\npowers of an owner as against a\npeaceful and innocent possessor\nare procedural. The right of recaption (self-help) was limited to\nfresh pursuit and eventually\nlost altogether.4 The right even\nto restitution through court help\nhas been limited by a series of\nstatutes of limitation. On a procedural basis, too, was worked\nout a theory that served as a doctrine of accession. Common\n\n\fwhich has its counterpart in\nother systems, seems never to\nhave taken root in America. We\nhave no thieves market where\ntitles may be purified for buyers.\nOn the other hand, we did, more\nor less unconsciously, take over\na notion that benefits sellers\nnamely, that money has no earmarks.7 Likewise, we took over\nanother exception to the doctrine that one cannot give more\nthan he owns for the benefit of\ntradesmen rather than buyers,\nthe doctrine that a wrongdoer\ncan give an effective lien on the\ngoods of another to an innkeeper.8 Surely American law\nbegins with no particular bias in\nfavor of buyers.\n2. Principles\nof the Law of Transactions\nFive principles, however, that\nhave their germs in the early law,\nhave been allowed to develop so\nas to reverse this condition since\nthe American Revolution:\n(1) The first is negotiability\nand its extensions.\n(2) The second is agency and\nits extensions.\n(3) The third is rather a limitation of a growing principle\nthat voidable titles cannot be set\naside so as to interfere with the\nintervening right of innocent\nstrangers.\n(4) The fourth is a corollary\nof our public registration of\ndocuments.\n(5) The fifth is hardly a principleit is the tendency to create a strong or irrebuttable presumption of the regularity of acts\nin the ordinary course of business, and perhaps an opposite\npresumption as to acts inconsistent with business usage.\nLet us examine briefly the\nbearing of each of these on the\nposition of a buyer in modern\nbusiness:\n(1) NEGOTIABILITY OF INSTRUMENTS AND ITS EXTENSIONS. In negotiable instru-\n\nwww.suspicions.com\n\nments we have the extreme form\nof the merchants rejection of the\nnotion that one cannot sell a\nbetter title than he has. However\nwe undertake to make a reconciliation of the attitude of the law\nmerchant with the common\nlawwhether we say negotiation\ncuts off equities, or that it makes\npresumptions absolute, or that\nit excludes personal defenses, or\nthat the man who voluntarily\nputs such a document into circulation impliedly consents to\nthis or thatthe simple fact is\nthat the law of negotiable instruments provides that a man can\nsell a better title than he has. We\nare too apt to overlook the revolutionary nature of this innovation when we try to explain the\nresistance to the introduction\nand extension of the doctrine in\nEngland until Mansfields day. On\nthe other hand, we are likely to\nmisunderstand the obstinacy of\nthe merchants of Lombard Street\nwhich finally triumphed. As a\npractical matter, a foreign document which could be assigned\nonly subject to all the facts of the\ncase and thus could not be taken\nas telling its whole story on its\nface, could not be taken at all.\nIn recent times the principle\nthat a better title than a particular seller has to a negotiable instrument can be sold, has appealed to the business world to\nsuch a degree that it has sought\nto extend it to an increasing\nrange of transactions. It endeavored to make its corporate bonds\nfollow the form and come within\nthe principles of promissory\nnotes.9 It dealt with stock certificates much as it did with\nbonds, and, after attempting to\nmake them as nearly negotiable\nas possible by what it printed on\nthem, succeeded eventually in\nhaving legislation passed in\nmany jurisdictions to make them\nactually negotiable.10 More important, however, for our present\npurpose is the legislation making documents of title, ware-\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\nsense requires the concession\nthat a thing may, for legal purposes, be deemed to have been\ndestroyed when it has been\nhopelessly imbedded into something else or converted into another substance.5 Hard as that\nline is to draw, once it is drawn\nthe legal consequences of destruction may be visited on the\nman guilty of making the destructive accession, but the\ngoods may not be reclaimed from\nhim nor followed into the hands\nof a purchaser from him. A few\nother situations arose in odd\nplaces in the law in which a man\ncould buy goods and resist any\nclaim on the part of a former\nowner who had not consented to\ntheir saleas when a new title\nwas created by a judicial sale in\nrem, a forfeiture, bankruptcy,\nmarriage, intestacy, or where the\nlaw for very good reasons empowered an officer or appointee\nto act instead of an owner for the\nconveyance of that owners title.\nIn none of these situations was\nthere any thought of serving the\nneed of modern business of making transactions stand even as\nagainst outraged ownership\nbut by furnishing prototypes in\nwhich the theory of ownership\nyielded and transactions stood,\nthey became extremely important eventually when a motive\nemerged for striking a new balance between the sanctity of\nownership and the importance of\nupholding transactions.\nThe first limitation on ownership in English law based substantially on the business considerations in favor of the security\nof transactions was probably the\ndoctrine of market overt.6 The\nidea seems to have been that if\na thing was exposed and sold in\na market overt in the ordinary\ncourse of business, the buyer\ntook a clear title. The transaction\nwas not only good between the\nparties but also binding on all\nthose who had any right or property in the goods sold. This law,\n\n27\n\n\fNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\nhouse receipts,11 and bills of\nlading,12 when properly drawn,\nnegotiable. Negotiable instruments familiarized the business\nworld and the lawyer with several concepts such as due\ncourse, bona fide purchaser for\nvalue without notice, as well as\nwith the general idea of the security of a transaction, and these\nideas were found useful eventually in connection with the other\nprinciples that came more directly to the aid of buyers.\n\n28\n\n(2) AGENCY AND ITS EXTENSIONS. Agency in its strict sense\nand narrower applications is, of\ncourse, no illustration of the extension of any special favor to\nbuyers. It is only when, by a liberal interpretation of apparent\nscope in the light of the ordinary\ncourse of business, an agent of\na dealer is clothed with powers\nbeyond his authorization, that\nthe buyer is benefited. The principle is not different in theory\nfrom that which would equally\nbenefit sellers or other contracting parties under similar circumstances. In practice, however,\nbuyers are very important beneficiaries of this principle. Not\nonly are they entitled to assume\nthe ordinary powers of warranty\nin the agents with whom they\ndeal, but also the power to sell\nthe things in their possession- so\nfar as consistent with the ordinary course of the trade.13 There\nis, however, a further extension\nof the principle which makes it\npossible in an increasing variety\nof cases to treat a person to\nwhose possession goods have\nbeen entrusted as an agent to\nsell by reason of the holding\nout, though in fact he is not an\nagent at all.14 This quasi-agency\nhas been technically built up on\nthe basis of estoppel. In fact, it\nhas come about in response to\nthe business need for the protection of buyers in the ordinary\ncourse of business.\n\n(3) TRANSFER TO INNOCENT\nPURCHASER OF VOIDABLE TITLE\nOR ONE HAVING INCUMBRANCE.\nTangible things are not negotiable. There are situations,\nhowever, in which the holder of\na voidable title can transfer a\nperfectly good title to an innocent purchaser for value. A title\nacquired by fraud, duress, undue\ninfluence, or under any other\ncondition in which a contract\nmay be set aside at the option of\nthe victim, may have to stand if\nthe rights of an innocent\nstranger have intervened.15 It is\ntrue that there is a difference in\ndegree between the situations in\nwhich the fraudulent purchaser\nof a horse gives a good title and\nthat in which the finder of a negotiable instrument, payable to\nbearer, passes a good title.\nThus, where the transferor has\nno title to the object the buyer\nfrom him gets none.16 But the\nconception of what constitutes\nbona fides, what constitutes\nvalue, what constitutes notice in\nthe conception of the bona fide\n(or innocent) purchaser for value\nwithout notice, tends to be taken\nbodily from negotiable instruments law and read into the law\nof dealings in goods by fraudulent owners. There has accordingly been a relaxation in\nlate years. Whereas formerly\nsome states disqualified the innocent purchaser who though\nwithout actual notice might have\nacquired knowledge,17 today the\ntendency is to require the proof\nof actual knowledge of the defect or such facts that his action\nin taking the commodity\namounts to bad faith, before he\nis disqualified from taking a better title than his seller had.18\nLikewise, the value with which he\nmust part is anything that will\nserve to support a simple contract as consideration,19 such as\na promise, or forbearance, or a\ndischarge of a debt. It need not\nbe present value. The law is very\nliberal to the buyer under such\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nwww.suspicions.info\n\nconditionsmore liberal, for example, than to one who buys\nfrom a defaulting trustee.20\nWhere ones defect in title is\nnot due to its voidability, but simply to the existence of a condition or incumbrance, under the\ncommon law theory it can be sold\nonly subject to the incumbrance.21 If the object had previously been mortgaged, the innocent purchaser has only his folly\nto thank when it is taken from\nhim to satisfy the mortgage. The\nsame principle applies to a conditional sale or to any other arrangement whereby a creditor\nhas retained or acquired a legal\ninterest in the subject matter of\nthe sale. Unless something could\nbe done to protect an innocent\npurchaser against such secret\nincumbrances, all security of\ntransactions would disappear.\n(4) RECORDING OF DOCUMENTS. As to real property the\nsame problem existed, though\nthe inconvenience of requiring a\nlong drawn-out investigation was\nnot felt as so prohibitive a burden because of the relatively\ngreater size and importance of\nthe transaction. Several solutions\nor partial solutions of the difficulty have found their way into\nour statute books, most of which\ninvolve a public notice, filing, or\nrecord. If such public notice, filing, or record is neglected, the\nlaw declares the transaction void,\nor at least inoperative as to\nstrangers. There is considerable\ndiversity in recording laws as to\nthe strangers benefited by their\nviolationswhether they must\nbe purchasers and if so whether\njudgment creditors are to be considered purchasers, whether they\nmust be ignorant of the prior\ntransaction, and so on. A difference between real estate and\npersonal property was discovered early in the development of\nthe laws of public notice. There\nwas no difficulty as to where the\nrecord should be made for real\n\n\f(5) PRESUMPTION OF REGULARITY OF ACTS IN BUSINESS.\nThe old law used to expect a\ngreat deal from the man on the\nstreet. He was not only expected\nto be circumspect, to examine\nthe title and quality of everything\nhe bought, but he was expected\nto know a good deal about the\ncorporations with which he dealt.\nHe was supposed to make sure\nthat they existed according to\nlaw, that they had the power to\ndo that which they undertook,\nand that the officers through\nwhom they acted were the duly\nconstituted officers. A bank dealing with a corporation can and\ndoes demand evidence for its\nrecords of all these things. The\nordinary customer of the corporation does not and cannot. In\nthe early days of the use of the\ncorporation in private business\nthere was a possibility at one\ntime that the doctrine of ultra\nvires would be so applied as to\nhamper the usefulness of the\ncorporate form in business. But\ngradually the whole doctrine began to fade out of the picture. A\nlegal necessity for a technical\ninvestigation at the threshold of\neach of the hundreds of contracts made in a modem business day is an intolerable burden.\n\n1\n\nFirst Nat.

The test of relative\nvalues, however, which has been\nwidely applied in this country,\ndiffers quite radically from the test\nof change of species of the Roman\nlaw, and the injection of a distinction against a willful trespasser\ngoes to distinguish the AngloAmerican doctrine of accession\nfrom that of the Romans.\n6\n\n2 Co.

But\nsuppose a public notice was effected as to a chattel mortgage\non a piano in Buffalo, New York,\nand that piano was wrongfully\nsold while the mortgage was\nunsatisfied, in Cleveland, Ohio,\nto an innocent purchaser. In such\na case it was held that the mortgagee had done all that the law\nrequired him to do and that the\ndoctrine of caveat emptor would\napply. 22 In other words, the\nbuyer is not so effectively protected in the case of personal\nproperty as he is in the case of\nreal estate, though the devices\nadopted for his protection are\nsimilar. This is particularly noticeable in the case of automobiles. They are very commonly\nincumbered with chattel mortgages or conditional sales, and\nyet they are so easily moved from\ncounty to county and state to\nstate that the chattel mortgage\nlist in some remote county is certainly no protection to a prospective buyer. Consequently, we\nhear. suggestions as to national\nrecording for automobile encumbrances, or checks on the transfer of automobiles through the\nofficial issuing of licenses, and\neven the requirements of formalities and public notice subject to\npenalties, in connection with every sale of a car. The problem is\nnot solved, but it seems to be\ntaken for granted that a simple\nreturn to caveat emptor is not a\nsatisfactory solution. We may\nhave to put the buyer to some\ntrouble in the examination of\nrecords, and we may have to\nleave him subject to some\nchance, but we take it for granted\nthat the law should be relied on\nto devise some means for making the buyer of personal property as well as real estate, of used\narticles as well as new ones, reasonably safe against incumbrances.\n\n29\n\n\fWhere money can be described\nand identified as a specific chattel\nit is, of course, a subject of\nconversion.

Protection\nof Business Property\nThe interests which the law\nrecognizes and protects in physi-\n\ncal things, both movable and\nimmovable. are the subject of\nanother volume in this series.1\nSubject to some limitations indicated in the last chapter, the\nrules of property law that have\ngrown up outside of business\nmust suffice for business. When\nwe turn to the intangible values,\nhowever, we are confronted with\nsome new types of property or\nquasi-property for which business insistently demands and\nthe law reluctantly accords recognition. Of course, it makes\nlittle difference to the business\nman whether you accord the\nname property to his goodwill,\nhis trade-marks, trade names,\nsecret formulae, advantage of\nhaving a going concern, advantageous contract, established\nlabor relations and other similar\nadvantages, and even his nuisance values. He is very much\nconcerned, however, in the manner in which the law protects\nsuch interests from subtle attacks, in the manner of his being taxed because of them, in the\nquestion of their transferability\neither in gross or in connection\nwith property in tangible things,\nand in what facilities the law furnishes for staking out, recording,\npublishing and perpetuating\nsuch interests. To put the matter another way, the reason these\ninterests are treated in certain\nways is not that they are or are\n\nwww.suspicions.com\n\nnot property. On the contrary,\nthey become or fail to become\nessentially like property because\nof the way they are treated.\n(1) TRADE-MARKS AND TRADE\nNAMES. We have, in an-other connection, already considered the\nnature of the protection accorded\ntrue trade-marks and trade names,\nand also the similar protection\nagainst unfair competition accorded trade symbols that fall\nshort of the technical requirements of trade-marks and\ntrade names. The influence of the\nproperty idea is seen, however, in\nthe different rules of damages allowed for infringement and for\nunfair competition where there is\nno infringement. In the case of the\nAmerican Girl Shoe2 much turned\non this question. If this name were\ntaken to be fanciful, a full accounting of the profits of the defendant\nwould have to be made, whether\nhe sold to new customers or to\nthe old customers or the plaintiff.\nIf, however, the term were taken\nto be geographical and descriptive\nthe offender would be answerable\nonly for the loss suffered by his\ncompetitor, the plaintiff. The difference was considerable. Fortunately for the plaintiff, the full\ntrade-mark included a picture of\nan American girl, and for this and\nother reasons the court leaned to\nthe conclusion that the name was\na fanciful one.\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\n1. Business Property\nDefined\nWhen the business man lists\nhis assets for a financial statement, he is not exactly making\nan inventory of his property in\nthe legal sense of the word. The\ntraditions of accounting require\nhim to list a combination of past\nand present facts and guesses\ntogether with some future hopes\nand with adjustments based on\naverages or estimated averages,\nand the result of the calculation\nyields a purely artificial surplus.\nThe practice serves some practical purposes. Linking the plant\nfigure to original costs and allowing depreciation on the basis of\napproved averages prevents the\nintroduction of entirely fantastic\nfigures. When an expense such\nas taxes has been incurred and\nthe amount is unknown, a guess\nmust be allowed for reserves. Receivables, as well as goodwill,\nare, like faith, necessarily the\nsubstance of things hoped for.\nBut behind this list may be discerned the elements of value, the\nlegal rights in which we may call\nproperty. Some of these elements are in land and buildings,\nsome in movable tangible goods,\nsome in intangibles.\n\n31\n\n\fNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\n(2) EXISTING CONTRACTS. A\nmans reasonable expectation\nthat strangers will not induce\nbreaches of his existing contracts is an intangible interest\nnow fully protected by law. This\nrule had its humble beginnings\nin the cases of interfering with\nor enticing ones servants. It\ngained clarity from the famous\ncase of Lumley v. Gye3 in which\ntwo London music hall owners\nclashed over the attempt of one\nto induce a singer to jump her\ncontract with the other. It has\nsince had many repercussions in\nthe growing law of labor relations, boycotts, and unfair competition. The rule does not insist\nthat the contract be formal or of\nstated duration. In fact, it has\nbeen extended to cover cases\nwhere a contract was only in contemplation, and therefore, by\nanother step, to the protection\nof goodwill in general.\n\n32\n\n(3) PROTECTION OF GOODWILL. (a) Definition of Goodwill.\nGoodwill has been variously defined. To the accountant it is apt\nto mean a capitalization calculated to represent the invisible\nsource of otherwise unexplained\nsurplus of earnings over the average in comparable industries.\nFrom this point of view a business with average earnings has\nno goodwill, and one that is losing money has, if anything, a\nnegative goodwill. But to the\nbusiness man it is quite evident\nthat even the business which is\nlosing money may have certain\nintangible, invisible and\nimponderable advantages that\ndo not show currently in the\nearnings or that show in the form\nof a diminution of losses. Occasionally he calls on the lawyer\nto phrase such advantages in\nappropriate form for purposes of\ntransfer. The lawyer is apt to begin with a concept of goodwill\nwhich likens it to the beaten path\nto ones business door. In fact,\nwhen this expression was first\n\nused in the law books it was no\nmere figure of speech. Goodwill\nwas associated with a specific\nplace. It was a kind of secondary\ninterest in land. Hence, there still\nlingers the idea that it cannot be\nsold without some interest in\nland. This concept is not adequate to explain the facts of\nbusiness. The goodwill of a\nprofessional man will follow him\nfrom office to office, as he moves.\nThe owner of a route for hawking or milk delivery or service\nmay be landless. Even a local\nstore can move about considerably within a city without losing\nits identity or its patronage. A\nchain-store may have a beaten\ntrack, on the basis of other\nstores in the system, the moment\nit opens its doors in a new neighborhood.\n(b) Agreements in the Sale\nof a Business or Practice. Let us\nanalyze what takes place when a\ndoctor or lawyer undertakes to\nsell his practice. In the first\nplace he probably agrees to introduce his successor to his clientele, or to permit his successor to so introduce himself. He\nmay actually hand over his lease\nand assign other useful contracts. He may deposit his\nrecords with the new man. He\nmay consent to the transfer of\nhis telephone number. He probably will agree not to compete\ndirectly or indirectly with his successor or to interfere with the\nreasonable attempts of his successor to take his professional\nplace. A similar set of agreements may very easily be conceived of in connection with the\nsale of a business. In fact, the law\nhad occasion to analyze the sale\nof the goodwill of a business long\nbefore it was able to dissociate\nthe idea from real estate. It had\nto decide, for example, whether\na sale of goodwill implied, in the\nabsence of specification, an\nagreement not to compete, and\nit leaned quite naturally to the\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nwww.suspicions.info\n\nview that no such agreement was\nimplied. It is, therefore, necessary in drawing agreements for\nthe transfer of such intangible\ninterests to describe fully what\neach side undertakes without\nrelying too much on the denotation or connotation of such\nwords as goodwill, route,\npractice, and their approximate\nequivalents.\n(c) Agreement Not to Compete. Another handicap that the\nlaw has imposed on efforts to\ntraffic in goodwill grows out of\nthe theory that an agreement not\nto compete or not to engage in\nthe trade or profession for which\none has been trained, is against\npublic policy. The older cases\nfollowed this theory. Eventually,\nescapes were found by distinguishing between those agreements unlimited in time and\nspace and those which were limited. An actual examination of\nthe decisions shows that a failure to limit time made little or\nno difference so long as the\nspace was limited. Some odd\npractices developed under this\nmechanical rule, such as agreements not to compete except in\nsome out-of-the-way spot or\nsome unlikely state or country.\nFinally the modern rule was\nevolved: that in every case the\nreasonableness of the restraint\nin view of the legitimate end to\nbe accomplished must be the\ntest of validity.4\n(d) Protection of Goodwill\nfrom Agent or Employee. In contrast to the reluctance of the law\nin facilitating the transfer of\ngoodwill and in protecting it\nagainst onslaughts from without,\nstands the alertness of the law\nto protect it against attacks from\nwithin an organization. Ones\nagent owes the highest degree\nof loyalty and fidelity. This duty\nis interpreted as including the\nrenunciation of any advantage\ninconsistent with the interests of\n\n\fthe employer; it extends beyond\nthe time of the termination of the\nagency, for the former employee\nis not free to utilize confidential\ninformation, or other similar advantage received while in the\nemploy of his principal, in competition with that principal either\non his own behalf or on behalf\nof a new employer. The fiduciary\nquality of the relationship invites\nthe ready intervention of the\ncourts of equity. Such a court will\nenjoin not only the agent or\nformer agent from wrongfully\nutilizing his advantage, but also\nthose conniving with him. Injunctions have protected trade secrets and trade lists, and prevented the solicitation of customers of the former employer.5 At\ntimes there is a difficulty raised\nin deciding whether the goodwill\ninvolved really belongs to the\nagent or to his employer. Consequently we occasionally see not\nonly specifications in contracts\non the subject, but ingenious\nefforts to direct the development\nof goodwill. A bond house, for\nexample, in its desire to build up\na regular clientele, may adopt\nrules and practices calculated to\nmake the customer feel that he\nis the customer of the house and\nnot of the salesman.\n\n(4) INTANGIBLES AS BUSINESS\nASSETS. (a) Recognition by Law.\nUndoubtedly the laws recognition of intangibles as a kind of\n\nwww.suspicions.com\n\nproperty has been accelerated by\nthe desire of the state to make\nthem bear a share of the property tax load. The methods employed have varied widely. At one\ntime the prevailing method was\nmerely to list on the tax duplicate such intangibles as claims,\nwhether evidenced by writing or\nnot, whether secured by mortgage or not, whether in the\nreadily available form of bank\ndeposits or in the more entangling combinations of shares of\nstock, corporate bonds, or beneficial interests in trusts or business ventures. This system was\nunsatisfactory because under it\nconcealment was so easy and so\ngenerally connived at that scandalously small returns came in.\nFurthermore, it permitted the\ntotal escape of other important\ntypes of intangibles, such as\ngoodwill. Eventually, elaborate\nschedules were worked out to\nget at the intangibles of business. Massachusetts, for example, led the way with a system\nfor taxing corporations under\nwhich the total net value of the\ncorporation minus the value of\nthe tangible property taxed was\nlooked upon as the intangible\nvalue, to be taxed as such. The\ncoming of income taxes, both\nstate and Federal, has tended to\nshift emphasis from taxes on intangibles.\n(b) Situs for Taxation of Intangibles. Nevertheless, nice legal questions still arise as to the\nsitus for taxation of various kinds\nof intangible property. The law\nbegan its attack by relying on the\nmaxim mobilia sequuntur personam, a maxim originally intended to cover tangible movable\nproperty, but eventually found\ntoo cumbersome a fiction for its\noriginal purpose. Hence, much\nlearning was devoted to such\nquestions as the situs of a debt\nor, rather, of a claim based upon\na debt, the situs of a share of\nstock, or the sit us of a bank ac-\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\n(e) Protection from the\nMiddleman; Refills. The coming\nof the middleman into business\nhas created some new problems,\nwhich the law has not yet solved,\nin the protection of the goodwill\nof the manufacturer. His legal\ninability to impose restraining\nconditions on the power of the\nmiddleman to sell his goods has\nfrequently placed his reputation\nat the mercy of the careless or\nunscrupulous dealer. A long debate has only recently come to\nan end as to whether it hurts the\nreputation of goods to use them\nas loss leaders or otherwise cut\ntheir prices. With the upholding\nby the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States of the Fair Trade\n\nActs of California and Illinois,6\nand the adoption of similar acts\nby forty-one other states and the\nUnited States Congress,7 it is\nnow possible at last for the\nmanufacturer to control the retail sales price of his branded\ngoods. But he is still battling with\nthe middleman who finds it more\nprofitable to sell non-genuine\nparts or refills for machines of\nvarious kinds. Unless a very\ngood case is made out, such an\nattempt on the part of the manufacturer looks like full line forcing, a recognized variety of unfair competition. He is waging a\nlosing battle with the substituter\nwho openly recommends substitution, especially under the impact of the price maintenance\nlaws. In his effort to prevent his\npackages from being refilled, he\nhas called in not only the aid of\nthe inventor (with non-refillable\nbottles for beverages and lubricating oil), but also of the legislator who lays down penalties on\nthe misuse of milk bottles, or of\nthe courts which once enjoined\nthe refilling of containers marked\nPrest-o-lite with other makes of\nacetylene gas8 and now insist\nthat the shells of Champion\nSpark Plugs shall have every vestige of their original makers\nidentity sand-blasted off before\nthey are sold after being reconditioned.9 To get the full protection of labeling, the manufacturer announces that his product is never sold in bulk. When\nit is sold in bulk or is rebottled\nor packaged by the middleman,\ntrouble and recrimination of another sort arise. The courts are\ncalled on to prevent or at least\nregulate the use of the name of\na perfume-maker on what purports to be his own product in\npackages and combinations that\nare not his.10\n\n33\n\n\fNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\n34\n\ncount. The logical answer, at the\nhome (or perhaps on the person)\nof the owner, though it served\nas the basis of important constitutional decisions in its time,\nbecame less and less realistic as\nthe indicia of such claims came\nto be looked upon more and\nmore as things. Consider, for\nexample, the history of the stock\ncertificate. A century ago it was\napparently so unimportant that\nnone was generally given to the\nstockholder. The evidence of his\nownership was in the books of\nthe company. If for any reason\nhe wanted a certificate, a simple\nwriting was given to him which\nwas precisely what the name indicates: a statement by the\nproper official of certification to\nwhom it might concern that John\nDoe was on a certain day the\nowner of so many shares of the\ncapital stock of the company.\nWhatever satisfaction, profit or\nstanding this certificate gave\nJohn Doe, it did not enable him\nto consummate a sale of his interest without applying at the\noffice of the company. He might\nlose or destroy his certificate\nwithout endangering his position. In fact, there is every reason to suppose he could easily\nprocure another, and probably\nwould have to get another if\nproof of his ownership at a later\ndate became desirable. As larger\ncorporations developed, it became customaryit is hard to\nsay whento issue a certificate\nto every stockholder, and business men began to regard these\ntokens as something that ought\nto pass from hand to hand with\nproper endorsements on sale of\nthe stock. They stood for the\nstock. Eventually they were made\npractically negotiable by statute.\nTransactions could be based\nupon their physical presence as\nthe subject matter of pledges,\nexchanges, sales. The record in\nthe books of the company,\nthough still important for certain\ncompany purposes, becomes\n\nsecondary so far as dealings between other parties are concerned. Under these circumstances it becomes easy for a\nresident of New Orleans to leave\nhis securities in the hands of\nan agent in New York, where they\ncan be produced instantaneously\nas needed for every business\npurpose. It would be straining\nthe fiction too far to say that New\nYork shall not tax this property\nwithin its borders because it is\ntechnically not there. Ultimately,\nthe fiction yields to the new reality. Intangibles tend to be-come\ntangibles for practical purposes.\n(c) Valuation of Intangibles.\nIn the famous Adams Express\nCompany case,11 Ohio was upheld in its effort to find and appraise intangibles within the\nstate. The total value of the express companys business was\ncalculated on a reasonable basis,\nthen the total amount of its annual business and the portion of\nthe business done in Ohio was\nfigured out. Then by the rule of\nthreerather than by appraising\nthe value of office furniture,\ntrucks, printed forms, leases and\nother contractsthe value of the\ncompanys property in Ohio, that\nis, its going concern value, was\nestimated. This experiment was\nthe forerunner of numerous successful attempts in other states,\nand a few unsuccessful ones, to\nevaluate intangibles by indirect\nbut perfectly clear and reasonable methods.\nOf course, in order to take\naccount of the value of intangibles for taxation or other\npurposes, it is by no means imperative that we think of intangibles as separate items. The\nquestion of value might be attacked quite as well by regarding much that we have discussed\nin this chapter as a phase of the\nvisible tangible property before\nus. The difference between the\ngoing concern value of a business and its junk value is no\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nwww.suspicions.info\n\nmore striking than the difference\nin value between a live horse and\na dead one; yet no appraiser or\naccountant would think of writing the life of the horse down on\na separate line beneath the horse\nitself. The analogy goes a step\nfurther: it would be as impossible\nto sell going concern value separately from the business as it\nwould be to sell the life of the\nhorse to one customer and the\nhorse to another. The analogy\nwould be controlling, were it not\nfor our accounting practices,\nmany of which are ordained by\nlaw, which make it impossible to\nadjust values, once entered, by\nreason of such conditions as\nstoppage or acceleration of processes, or accretion of goodwill\nin most of the senses in which\nwe have applied the term, or any\nturn of luck not duly labeled in\nthe limited vocabulary of legal\naccountancy.\n\n1\n\nSee VoL V.\nHamilton-Brown Shoe\nCompany v.

Procedural Law\nand Business\nEvery hindrance to enforcement of claims is a clog on credit;\n\nwww.suspicions.com\n\ntracts that have some time to\nrun, such as lessees, employers,\nadvance purchasers of crops. On\nthe other hand, those at the opposite side of each of the transactions and situations suggested\nare creditors, including, to single\nout only a few, the depositors in\nbanks, the purchasers of insurance, the bondholders, landlords\nand employees under contracts.\nObviously modern business\nleaves very few of us free to follow the advice of Polonius, Neither a borrower nor a lender be.\n2. Action in Court\nThe principal burden of this\ncredit structure must be borne,\nin the last analysis, on the assumption that the creditor can,\nif necessary, bring an action in\ncourt against the defaulting\ndebtor and pursue his claim to\njudgment and satisfaction either\nby payment or through execution of the judgment by court\nofficers who seize and sell the\ndefaulters property. There are,\nto be sure, some other aids at\nthe disposal of the creditor that\nserve as props of the credit system. In extraordinary cases, tribunals administering criminal\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\nCredit, a very important part\nof the modern business system,\nis founded upon the enforcement\nmachinery of the law. Yet this\nmachinery has been but little influenced by modern business\nideas. Procedure is essentially\nthe same in our courts, whether\ndamages are sought or not;\nwhether we are concerned with\nbuying and selling or with matters so far from the workaday\nworld as the claim of a bishop\nfor having been ousted wrongfully from his seat; whether there\nis an accusation of false advertising or of murder; whether equity is invoked to enjoin unfair\ncompetition or to test the constitutionality of a new marriage\nlaw. Procedure is thus not a distinctive part of Business Law. It\nis, however, within the scope of\nour purpose to study the impact\nof procedural law as we find it\non Business.\n\nevery facilitation is an encouragement to its use. Legislation calculated to protect the debtor,\ntherefore, frequently operates as\na boomerang by preventing the\nextension of credit to the prospective debtor. That we are all\nat one and the same time debtors and creditors became clear\nwhen the cheapening of the dollar was before the country as a\nlive issue. In general, such a process might be expected to redound to the benefit of debtors\nwho could wipe out their debts,\nas a result, with a smaller value\n(let us say in terms of food or\nlabor) and, accordingly, to the\ndetriment of creditors. Debtors\ninclude all those who have borrowed money on their farms, all\nwho have bought on the installment plan, all who have run up\ntroublesome bills, and tenants in\narrears, to be sure; but as the\nrich and powerful can borrow\nmore readily than the poor, by\nfar the greatest group of debtors are corporations with large\nbond issues, the business borrower from commercial banks,\nthe banks themselves, insurance\ncompanies, and prospectively all\npersons at the paying end of con-\n\n35\n\n\fNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\nlaw, equity, bankruptcy law, administrative law, or association\nrules may be feared more by the\ndebtor than an ordinary court\nawarding damages for a simple\nbreach of contract. In still other\ncases, as we shall see in the next\nchapter, ingenious arrangements for the safeguarding of\ncredit may overshadow the ordinary legal procedure. Finally, in\npetty credit transactions, the\nprobable willingness of the\ndebtor to pay rather than the\ncreditors ability to make him pay\nis the basis of the extension of\ncredit. Consumer credit is readily\nextended in cases where it is\nobvious that it would not pay to\nbring any action, both because\nof the cost in time, money and\nundesirable publicity and because liberal exemption laws\nwould probably render the\ndebtor execution-proof. Yet, after all these concessions are\nmade, the simple action at law\nfor damages for breach of contract remains the very backbone\nof the credit system.\n\n36\n\n(1) STEPS IN PROCEDURE It\nwill, therefore, be worth while to\nmake a special examination of\nsome phases of this type of action here, though courts and actions at law in general are discussed more fully elsewhere in\nthese volumes.1 In the simplest\ncase, it is necessary (1) to have\nthe adverse party brought into\ncourt, literally or figuratively, (2)\nto have the claim and the essential facts on which it is based\nstated, (3) to give the other side\nan opportunity to state its side\nof the case, (4) to focus the dispute in issues, whether of law\nor fact, (5) to have a trial of the\nissues, (6) to render judgment,\nand (7) to enforce the judgment.\nIn addition to these essential elements, our legal tradition provides for one or more opportunities for judicial review in a higher\ntribunal and for various processes in aid of execution in the\n\nenforcement of a judgment. The\nfunction of each of these steps\nbecomes painfully obvious in a\npoorly planned arbitration proceeding, when the parties persist\nin dragging in grievances that\nmerely tend to confuse the merits of the case being heard, and\nthe arbitrators are quite helpless\nabout excluding them because\nno clear issue has been presented to them. On the other\nhand, too rigid an adherence to\nthe rules of the game, as developed in the long history of\ncourt procedure, may result in\nvarious failures from the business mans point of view, notably excessive costs, delays, arbitrariness, and technicality, by\nwhich he means- not only excessive fussiness about trifles, but\nthe actual sacrifice of the merits\nof the case to a rule that seems\nto have lost its sense if it ever\nhad any.\n(2) PLEADING. The history of\npleading, by which the lawyer\nmeans the steps in framing an\nissue, is in point. A century ago,\ncommon law pleading had developed a fine spun system of logic\nwhich forced parties to select\nsingle claims on a single narrow\nquestion squeezed out under\nthat system. The simplification of\npleading according to various\npatterns is an outstanding\nachievement of nineteenth century jurisprudence in England\nand America. Most jurisdictions\ntoday call for a clear and concise\nstatement of the essential facts\non which a claim is basednot\nthe evidence of the facts nor\nmere inferences drawn from the\nfacts, but, so far as such distinctions of degree can be made in\npractice, the operating facts\nthemselves. The defense is to be\nstared in the same way, if it is a\nfact defense, so that a jury may\npass on the truth of the allegations. If the parties agree on the\nfacts, for the sake of argument,\na question of law may be raised\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nwww.suspicions.info\n\nfor the court to decide by a demurrer, the legal equivalent of\nthe colloquial, So what?\nIn petty courts of limited jurisdiction, very informal pleadings will serve the purpose, such\nas oral pleadings or so-called\nnotice pleadings, provided judicial discretion is preserved to\ndemand bills of particulars when\nthe course of justice will thereby\nbe aided. Liberal delays, however, should not be granted\nwhere there is no possible element of surprise in the revelations of such a bill of particulars.\n(3) THE JURY. The traditional\nfact-finding tribunal of the common law courts, for both criminal and civil cases, is the jury.\nThe literature in praise of the jury\nsystem is vast and venerable;\nthat against it, somewhat meager and recent. It is gratuitously\ndescribed as a bulwark of the\nAnglo-Saxon liberties, though\nthe Anglo-Saxons had never\nheard of it. When it was introduced in England by the Conqueror, it looked very much like\nthe Inquisition, with which it\nwas, in fact, historically identical\nIt was based on the Kings royal\nprerogative to force subjects\nunder oath to tell him the truth,\nparticularly unpleasant truths\nabout one another. It was used\nin the compilation of Doomsday\nBook, the record devised to give\nthe King all of his feudal dues\nfrom every manor. A century later\nit reappears as the Grand Jury, a\ngroup of citizens sworn to tell the\nKing all the gossip that might\nlead to prosecutions. It appears\nin court as a fact-finding device,\nlent by the King, for a consideration, of course, some time after\nthe Fourth Lateran Council of the\nRoman Catholic Church forbids\npriests to lend their aid to\nmagico-religious trial by ordeal,\n1215. It had nothing to do with\nthe feudal judgment of ones\npeers mentioned in the contemporary Magna Carta. It was not\n\n\f(4) EVIDENCE. (a) Three Principles. Out of the peculiarities of\nour jury system grows our law of\nevidence. The voluminous works\nof Greenleaf a century ago and\nWigmore of our own day, to say\nnothing of Fletchers Encyclopedia of the Law of Evidence, supplemented by the quarrels we hear\nin the court room over the exclusion of bits of evidence and the\nlarge percentage of reversals in\nhigher courts on the basis of errors in the law of evidence, are\ncalculated to inspire the lawyer as\nwell as the layman with awe in\n\ncontemplation of this esoteric\nsystem of logic. It is no wonder\nthat legislatures write into the\nlaws governing administrative tribunals and arbitrators that they\nshall not be governed by technical rules of evidence. And yet the\nwhole system is built on only\nthree principles, all of which are\nalluded to every time a lawyer\nobjects: Incompetent, irrelevant\nand immaterial. Two of these\nprinciples should give the layman\nvery little trouble. What is irrelevant is a question of logic. What\nis immaterial, though remotely\nrelevant, is a question of common\nsense. What is incompetent is a\nquestion of law.\n(b) The Principle of Competency. Hearsay, for example, may\nbe both relevant and material.\nWe rely upon it every day in the\nmost important affairs of life. Yet\nthe law keeps it from the ears of\nthe jury because it is not comparable, for court purposes, to testimony under oath, subject to the\ngreat corrective of cross-examination. What makes the books on\nEvidence so voluminous is the\nexceptions and apparent exceptions to the hearsay rule. The\nbusiness world is interested in\nmany of these exceptions: the\nadmissibility of books of account\nand other business records, the\nuse of public records, the functions and limitations of expert\ntestimony, the question as to\nwhat words in a transaction are\npart of the res gestae, what constitutes an admission against\ninterest, and so on. Business\nmen would, in general, throw the\nweight of their influence in favor\nof more liberal exceptions to the\nhearsay rule. They never resent\nthe discrepancy between their\nway of doing things and the\ncourts more than when challenged on the witness stand with\nwhat sounds like the comedians\nposer: Were you there ?\nSome other rules under the\ncompetency principle fare a little\n\nwww.suspicions.com\n\nbetter in the opinion of the business man. The rule that calls for\nthe best evidence, such as originals instead of copies, is entirely\nacceptable provided it permits\nthe use of the next best evidence\nfor what it is worth when a foundation is laid by giving a reasonable excuse for the non-appearance of the better type of evidence, and provided, further, no\nnonsense is indulged in about\nthe first note made by a clerk\nbeing better evidence than the\nfirst permanent record made in\nthe ordinary course of business.\nSo there is little opposition\nto the rule excluding certain\ntypes of witnesses for reasons of\npublic policy: the religious confessor or the husband or wife in\ncertain cases. In general, modern\nlaw does not exclude, as the\nolder law did, parties or other\ninterested persons, for fear they\nwill commit perjury. It listens to\nthem and takes their interest\ninto consideration in passing on\ntheir credibility. The principle of\ncompetency has been toned\ndown to meet the understandings of the layman. Yet, one\nstill hears too frequently from\nwitnesses: Every time I began to\ntell what I knew one of the lawyers objected and the judge\nstopped me.\n3. Slow Legal Procedure\n(1) ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES. The tradition of\nour law that gives a man not only\na day in court but two or three\nopportunities to be heard is\ntinged, like much of our procedure, with the philosophy of a\nmuch slower moving era than\nthat in which we live. There are\njustifications for proceeding\nslowly, deliberately, thoroughly,\nin that small percentage of disputes that reach the courts, for\nthe outcome must serve as a\nyardstick for innumerable similar transactions. Yet inequalities\narise from the power of the rich\nto keep or threaten to keep a\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\neven a fact-finding body for\nnearly three centuriesit was\nonly a fact-declaring body, a\ngroup of sworn witnesses rather\nthan sworn judges of fact. But it\ndid, in course of time, serve its\nfunction well. It not only found\nfacts of the kind entrusted to it\nefficiently, but bravely and independently. It always injected into\nthe administration of justice an\nelement of common sense that\nfrequently saved the law in action from the effects of the folly\nof legislatures. It has served as a\ntraining school of citizenship. On\nthe other hand, the system of calling in, qualifying and swearing\ntwelve men who know nothing\nabout a case and are not interested in it, in order to pass on a\nquestion of fact, is obviously cumbersome and expensive. If the fact\nis one beyond the ken of the ordinary man, if it involves business\npractices, figures, modern machinery, and the choice and application of standards of due care,\nordinary prudence, proper vigilance, customary precautions,\nreasonable time and reasonableness in general, doubts may be\nexpressed as to its fitness for its\nnovel tasks, however infallible it\nmight be in sensing where the\nblame lies in a street brawl. Finally, juries have prejudices and\nare not always beyond being\nreached and fixed, or swayed\nby resourceful lawyers.\n\n37\n\n\fNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\ncase in court beyond the endurance of the poor, whereas the\npoor man who loses a case in a\nlower court is practically precluded by the expense from carrying it higher. There are many\nsituations in business in which\nany decision is better than no decision, and a prompt rough decision is better than a meticulously\naccurate one coming several\nyears too late. Mercantile courts\nwere noted for their speed in the\nMiddle Ages, as Cokes amusing\nattempt to explain the name of\nthe Pie-Powders Courts reminds\nus. He says that, in these courts,\njustice was dispensed as rapidly\nas dust is shaken from the foot.\nIncidentally, the same Lord Coke\nexplains our whole system of\nappellate jurisdiction as traceable to the Law-Giver Moses.\nHowever valuable the system\nmay be, particularly if limited to\none trial and one review in ordinary cases, it is apt to be a hindrance in the simple cases on\nwhich the credit system is based.\n\n38\n\n(2) CUMBERSOME MACHINERY FOR COLLECTING JUDGMENTS. (a) Exemptions. Another\nsource of dissatisfaction with the\nlaw is the cumbersomeness of\nthe machinery for collecting\njudgments. Leniency with debtors has a good social basis. The\ncivilized world has passed beyond the imprisonment of unfortunate debtors pictured in the\nnovels of Dickens. It has, too,\nrecognized the importance of\npreserving the self-respect of the\nindividual and the integrity of the\nfamily through making some\nproperty execution-proof. In\nsome places these exemptions\nare so liberal that the whole\ncredit system must either be rebuilt on an artificial basis or\nabandoned for the ordinary citizen. Of course, by hiding behind\na corporate entity, even the small\nbusiness can create additional\nexemptions for itself.\n\n(b) Bankruptcy. The Federal\nBankruptcy Law, with its recent\namendments, sets still other\npractical limits to the collection\nof debts. The procedural details\nand other safeguards against\nabuse are too technical and too\nsubject to change to warrant inclusion here, but the principle of\nmodern bankruptcy is clear: the\nhonest debtor who surrenders all\nhis property to the court for administration for the benefit of his\ncreditors can have his debts discharged and begin again with a\nclean slate. This idea differs in\nalmost every detail from bankruptcy as it was understood in\nthe Middle Ages. The thought\nthen was rather to punish the\ndebtor than to discharge him; to\nprotect creditors rather than to\nsalvage debtors; it was allied to\ncriminal law rather than to the\nadministration of estates; it was\nalways involuntary, and it applied\nonly to traders. The recent\namendments further emphasize\nthe rehabilitation motive and\nyield reorganization facilities\nrather than bankruptcy in the\ntraditional sense. Yet the evolution of the new conceptions of\nbankruptcy have been so gradual\nand natural that it is generally\nbelieved the courts will find\nample justification for this legislation by Congress in the Constitutional Clause that gives it\nthe power to make uniform the\nlaw of bankruptcies throughout\nthe United States.\n4. To Make Obligations\nSecure\nTo escape the uncertainties\nof procedure and to make obligations, particularly credit obligations, more secure, business\nmen have resorted to three types\nof arrangements:\n(1) Contractual modification\nof the details of procedural law.\n(2) Resort to arbitration.\n(3) The special devices for\nsafeguarding credit, which are\nthe subject of the next chapter.\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nwww.suspicions.info\n\n(1) CONTRACTURAL MODIFICATION OF PROCEDURAL LAW.\nA generation ago courts were\ndenying the power of contracting\nparties to interfere with the procedure of courts. They frowned\non arbitration agreements which\ntended to oust the court of its\njurisdiction. They resisted attempts to state in advance the\namount to be paid to the injured\nparty in case of a breach. They\ndeclared void any stipulation that\na particular document shall be\ntaken as conclusive evidence.\nBusiness men were reminded\nthat they could not emancipate\nthemselves from the rules of evidence or the statute of frauds or\nthe statute of limitations which\nwere not of their own making nor\nwritten for their own convenience. Nevertheless, courts\nhave gradually been induced to\ntake a different view and to make\na distinction between those\nstipulations which tend to promote the general objects of court\nprocedure, though they do so in\na novel way, and those which\ntend in a contrary direction. They\nfirst made a distinction between\nstipulations for penalties, which\nthey held void, and stipulations\nfor liquidating damages, that is,\nestimating and agreeing upon\nsuch damages in advance, which\nthey held valid. They have upheld\nwaivers of many formalities, of\nsummons, of trial by jury, of appeal or other review, of exemptions within limits, and of some\ndefenses. They have upheld authorizations in notes and even in\nleases to confess judgments on\nthe contracts in case of defaults.\nThey have recognized liberally\nduring litigation, and more sparingly if made in advance, stipulations as to evidence and admissions. They have recognized\nreasonable curtailments of the\nperiod of limitations. On the\nother hand, they have refused to\nrecognize agreements to refer\ndisputes to one of the parties or\nhis nominee. They frown on\n\n\fstipulations that proof of one fact\nshall carry with it a conclusive\npresumption as to another. They\nhave refused to recognize unreasonable limitations of the period\nwithin which an action may be\nbrought. And some courts have\nsteadfastly refused to recognize\nmost of the waivers referred to\nabove.\n\n1\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\n(2) RESORT TO ARBITRATION. The legal position of arbitration has, in the period under\nreview, been completely\nchanged. The widely copied New\nYork (1925) statute not only\nmakes valid but irrevocable and\nspecifically enforceable agreements to arbitrate future disputes under a contract, as well\nas submissions of pending disputes. These modern statutes\nfurther permit and encourage\nsubmission to arbitration of the\nfact disputes in a case already in\ncourt, they provide court aid for\narbitration proceedings, including the subpoenaing of witnesses, ruling on questions of\nlaw, and the treatment of an\naward properly recorded as a\njudgment of the court. In general, however, these statutes are\npermissive, and whether they\nbecome widely useful or not will\ndepend in the first instance on\nhow well they are implemented\nby trade associations, chambers\nof commerce, and other voluntary groups, and, secondly, on\nthe extent to which they can cut\ndown the time, expense, publicity and animosity of court procedure without too great a sacrifice of the ultimate advantages\nof state or nation-supported\ncourts.\nSee General Index in Volume\n\nVI.\n\nwww.suspicions.com\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\n39\n\n\fChapter VII\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\nDevices for Safeguarding\n& Facilitating Credit\n\n40\n\n1. Fundamental Ideas in\nSafeguarding Credit\nCredit is older than the legal devices for credit. Consequently, from the earliest days\nwe find the ingenuity of the business man taxed to find ways of\nmaking himself safe in accepting a promise to pay rather than\na payment. The pledge idea\nseems to have grown among all\npeoples in some such way. The\nman who agreed to hand over a\ncow with which he was not ready\nto part, might leave his horse\ninstead with the understanding\nthat he could eventually substitute the cow. Suretyship seems\nalso to have grown up in this\nway. A friend or relative of the\ndebtor was probably left in the\ncustody of the creditor to be redeemed by the fulfillment of the\nobligation, whatever it might\nhave been, for which the law furnished no adequate means of\nenforcement. The mortgage, at\nleast the English mortgage, is on\nits face and perhaps was in its\norigin, the transfer of ones\nproperty to the creditor with the\nunderstanding that the property\ncould be redeemed by the performance of the principal obligation.\n\nEven after the law developed\nto the point where a simple\npromise, made in the course of\nbusiness, could be enforced, the\nmany slips between the bringing of the action and the actual\ncollection of the debt have\ncaused business men to look\naround for various means of\nmaking assurance doubly sure.\nThey have continued in the path\nblazed for them by those early\npioneers who created in various\ntimes and places the pledge\nidea, the suretyship idea, and\nthe mortgage idea. Thus, there\nhas come into being a good deal\nof contractual self-help in the\nmatter of credit, and various legal institutions have been\nwrested from their original setting to serve the purpose of\nmaking the creditor secure.\nThese include, besides the\npledge, suretyship, and mortgage already mentioned, various\napplications\nof\nagency,\nleaseholds, bailments, employment, partnership, the issuance\nof corporate securities, symbolic\npossession, negotiable paper,\nand anything else that the ingenuity of the business man can\nuse as the basis for feeling safe\nin extending credit or, to view it\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nwww.suspicions.info\n\nfrom the other angle, anything\nthat his ingenuity can devise to\ninduce another to become his\ncreditor.\nInstead, therefore, of approaching the business problem\nof using the laws devices for\ncredit from the point of view of\nthe law, and studying each institution mentioned in this\nhodgepodge, let us rather approach the problem of credit\nfrom the business point of view\nand refer to these institutions\nonly with regard to their adaptability for the purpose of safeguarding credit under various\nsets of facts.\n2. Credit from the Business\nPoint of View\nFrom the business mans\npoint of view there are two bases\nof credit outside of the ordinary\nlegal procedure for the collection\nof debts: first, personal security\nand, second, real security. Both\nof these terms are used in their\nliteral senses, that is, they refer\nto the simple fact that, in making a creditor more secure, we\nmay resort either to reliance on\nan additional person or to some\nthing (res) which shall be put\nunder the control of the creditor.\n\n\f(1) PERSONAL SECURITY.\nPersonal security may be added\nto a debt in many ways, including guaranty of several types,\nsuretyship, indemnity agreements, endorsement or other\nsigning for accommodation of\ncommercial paper, and del credere agency.\n\n(b) Suretyship. Ks proposition may be varied ever so little\nin words, with rather startling\nlegal effects. He may authorize\nthe giving of the goods to U, to\nbe charged jointly to K and U.\nThis we may call suretyship\nthough there is by no means\nunanimity among law writers in\nthe use of this word, as some\nappropriate it for what we have\ncalled guaranty of payment. In\nthe situation we have described,\nwe simply have a contract with\ntwo promisors on one side instead of one. Between these two\npromisors the situation is thoroughly understood. If K pays any\npart, U must indemnify him. If U\npays, the matter rests there. If\nthe promisee knows the nature\nof their relation, he will have to\nproceed with the same type of\ncaution as called for in the case\nof guaranty. Changing the risk\nor the burden of the surety without his consent will let him out.\n(c) Endorsement or Other\nSigning of Commercial Paper. K\ncan become a surety for U by\nsigning a promissory note along\nwith him.. Or he may sign the\nnote alone, making it payable to\nU, and U may endorse it to the\ncreditor. In either case, U, as a\nsigner of the note, is absolutely\nbound to pay and is not entitled\nto the benefit of the conditions\nenjoyed by the endorser whom\nwe have described as a con-\n\nwww.suspicions.com\n\nditional guarantor. In fact, the\ncreditor can get the benefit of\ntwo names on a negotiable instrument, regardless of the position that the parties, for convenience, choose for their\nnames, subject to the requirements imposed on the creditor\nby the negotiable instrument\nlaw and the stipulations in the\ndocument. Thus, K may appear\nas one of the persons unconditionally liable (the maker of a\nnote or the acceptor of a bill of\nexchange), or as one conditionally liable (the drawer of a bill of\nexchange or the endorser of either type of instrument).\n(d) Indemnity and Del Credere Agency. K may get into the\npicture of Us debt in a very different way, as an insurer of a\nbusiness man against certain\ncredit losses, and U may be only\none of the debtors. Such a contract is one of indemnity, and is\nsubject to the laws of insurance.\nAgain, K may be an agent selling the goods of D on credit to\na group of customers chosen\nand approved by K, with the understanding that he is to be responsible for U as one of these\ncustomers. K is then a del credere agent whom the law so far\ndistinguishes from a guarantor\nas not to include him under the\nStatute of Frauds as a person\nagreeing to answer for the debt\nof another.\nAll types of personal security have some of the weaknesses of the ordinary procedure at law because they are\nenforced through it. Furthermore, in the interpretation of\nthese contracts there is a strong\ntendency to give the benefit of\nevery doubt to the person who\npresumably got no advantage\nfrom the transaction. Thus, on\nsuch questions as whether an\noffer of guaranty called for a\nnotice of acceptance, whether\nthe completed contract called\nfor a notice of each action un-\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\n(a) Guaranty. These plans\nmay be illustrated simply by assuming that two men enter a\nstore together for the purpose\nof buying goods for one of them.\nLet us designate them as K,\nstanding for Known, and U,\nstanding for Unknown. Ks\ncredit is good, but his friend U\nis the one who wants the goods.\nK may, of course, say: Give U\nthe goods and send me the bill.\nThis transaction does not come\nwithin any of the classes, as U\nis outside of the contract altogether. But K is more likely to\nsay: Give U credit. If he does not\npay, I shall. This is a guaranty\nof payment. It must be reduced\nto writing and signed by K in\norder to be binding under the\nStatute of Frauds. Again, K may\nsay: Give U credit. If you cannot collect from him, or if he\nbecomes insolvent, I shall pay.\nThis is a guaranty of\ncollectibility or of solvency. It,\ntoo, requires writing. But, obviously, in order to complete his\nright of access to K, one must\ndo or show a great deal more\nthan in the case of guaranty of\npayment. Guaranties may be\nmade conditional upon the giving of certain notices, the keeping of certain records, the exercise of diligence in various ways\nand, of course, in such cases the\nlaw insists on the fulfillment of\nall conditions before it will hold\nthe guarantor. A simple endorsement of negotiable paper,\nwe shall see, carries with it such\na conditional guaranty: if demand is made on the person\nprimarily liable, in the right way,\nat the right place, at the right\n\ntime, and he refuses to pay, and\nif the requirements laid down in\nthe negotiable instrument law\nfor making a proper record and\ngiving notice of the facts are\ncomplied with, the indorser will\npay. In all of these cases of guaranty, it is to be noted that there\nare two contracts to pay: first,\nthat of the principal debtor; second, the collateral contract of\nthe guarantor, which must in itself satisfy all the requirements\nof the laws of contract to be\ncomplete.\n\n41\n\n\fNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\n42\n\nder it, notice of every default,\nand other precautions for the\nsafeguarding of the interests of\nthe guarantor, whether the contract was meant to cover a single\ntransaction or to run for a series of transactions, whether a\ncontract was a guaranty of payment or only a guaranty of solvency, all doubts are resolved in\nfavor of the guarantor. Such\nstrict care is enjoined for the\nbenefit of the guarantor, surety,\naccommodation party, and others similarly situated, except\nperhaps the paid surety company, and the defenses allowed\nby courts in such cases at times\nseem so unreasonable to business men that the use of personal security is limited in practice to comparatively few situations, and in most of these the\nparty secondarily liable is really\nan interested party: for example,\na large stockholder of a corporation who endorses its paper, a contractor who stands\nbehind the subcontractor so as\nto enable him to get his necessary materials, the seller of\ngoods who endorses his\ncustomers trade acceptance to\nhis bank, the automobile dealer\nwho assumes a contingent liability for his customers account to\nthe financing company.\n(2) REAL SECURITY. Real security (dependence on things)\npresents an even larger variety\nof frameworks for credit than\nthe personal arrangements already discussed. Unlike these,\nwhich are based almost entirely\nupon the contract idea, the real\nsecurity devices come from\nwidely scattered parts of the\nlawfrom Real Property, Personal Property, Contracts, Corporations, Agency, Trusteeship,\nPublic Records, Negotiable\nDocuments of Title, and from\nMortgages, which latter is compacted of several of these and\nwith peculiarities of its own. We\nshall, therefore, have to make\n\nbrief excursuses into remote\nparts of substantive law in explanation of some of the common plans.\nLet us first divide into three\nclasses the holds which a creditor may have on things belonging to the debtor: (a) possessory\nholds, (b) title holds, and (c)\ncombinations of these with\nother means of control.\n(a) Possessory holds will include all situations in which the\nactual physical control of the\nproperty passes to or remains\nin the creditor, even if, in addition, elements of the other\nmodes of control are included in\nthe plan. Here we may include\npossessory liens, pledges of\nthings, the deposit of symbols\nor documents of title or of documents carrying rights with them\nas collateral security. Sub-varieties of each of these or special\ncontractual modifications of\nthem exist and can be added\nwithout number. For our purposes the main features of their\ncommonly recurring forms will\nsuffice.\nPossessory Liens. It was formerly said that liens exist by virtue of statute, by common law\nor custom or by contract, but the\nnineteenth century was so contract-minded that it reduced\npractically all cases to contract,\nexpress or implied, and sought\nonly the evidence of some of its\nimplications in statutes, common law, or custom. Furthermore, it was anciently assumed\nthat a claim under a lien was one\nthing and a right of action in\ncontract was another, and that\nthe two would not coexist. But,\nagain, the all-pervasive theory of\ncontract prevailed, and liens are\nnow looked upon as secondary\nsupports for contracts in every\ncase.\nThe eighteenth century lawyer could enumerate the types\nof persons who had liens and\nsay whether the liens were spe-\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nwww.suspicions.info\n\ncialthat is, covering only the\ngoods involved in the transaction out of which the charge had\ngrown, or generalthat is, covering newly acquired goods for\nback-balances. The carrier, the\ninnkeeper, the repairman, the\nanimal trainer, and a host of others, had special liens. The wharfinger, the factor, and the packer\nhad general liens. The agister\nlost his lien through a curious\nmistake. The first printed case\non the subject was one of contract, and, therefore, the agister in that case had no lien. Two\ncenturies later, the courts had\nforgotten the learning necessary\nto explain that reasoning, and\nit was dogmatically said that the\nagister had no lien at common\nlaw. This rule made generalization difficult, but finally the text\nwriters rose to the occasion and\nlaid it down thus: whoever adds\nto the value of the thing entrusted to his care has the right\nto hold it until he is paid for his\nservices. As to general liens,\nthey said: whoever necessarily\nparts with goods in the course\nof giving the service for which\nthey were entrusted to his care\nmay have a lien for his balance\non other goods of the same\nowner coming into his hands.\nToday we have many possessory liens created or recognized\nby statute, such as the\ngaragemans lien, the unpaid\nsellers lien, and more that are\nexpressly covered by contract,\nsuch as landlords liens, stockbrokers liens, and, to jump to\nanother extreme, the analogous\nstipulation laid down by a college that no degree will be\ngranted to a student until all\narrearages are paid.\nA bare possessory lien is a\nnarrow, precarious right. In itself it carries no assurance of\npayment unless or until the\ndebtor becomes sufficiently eager to get his goods back to be\nmoved to redeem them. The fact\nthat today the creditor may sue\n\n\fbanker and the broker allow\nthem to sell out their borrowers with or without notice, at\npublic or private sale, to themselves or others practically\nwhenever the collateral holder\nbecomes sufficiently alarmed to\ndeem such action necessary for\nhis own protection. They further\ngenerally stipulate that the\nthing pledged may be utilized as\nsecurity for other claims of the\npledgee against the pledgor;\nthat the pledgee may repledge\nthe collateral; that the pledgee\nmay, but need not, take steps\nto protect the interest pledged\nor permit the pledgor to take\naction with reference to it when\nits value is endangered by a\nreorganization of the corporation issuing the security, but\nthat he may require the pledgor\nto do so; that the pledgee shall\nbe free from the ordinary obligation to account to the pledgor\nfor any surplus realized, and\nthat the pledgee be free of\nblame for all manner of conduct\nor misconduct.\nThe proponents of such\ndrastic forms for signature have\nsomething to say in self-defense. When security values begin to topple, quick action may\nbe essential not only to protect\nthe banks interest but also the\ninterests of the pledgor and of\nthe public whose money the\nbank controls. Furthermore,\nbanks may be trusted not to use\nthoughtlessly all the extreme\npowers entrusted to them. Prudence dictates that they be\narmed with powers for emergencies though such emergencies,\nadmittedly, rarely occur. In any\nevent, courts may be relied on\nto put a reasonable interpretation on such documents confessedly drawn by one side and\nsigned on the dotted line by the\nother. Finally, if there is a market quotation on the securities\npledged, there is no danger of\narbitrariness in the fixing of a\nsales price, regardless of how\n\nwww.suspicions.com\n\nthe sale is made. In view of the\nflood of complaints that reached\nthe courts after the stock crash\nof 1929, it is impossible to say\nthat this reassurance is very\nreassuring. Brokers contracts\nare already the subject of study\nby stock exchanges and administrative commissions, and\nbankers agreements may well\nbe submitted to voluntary or\ncompulsory revision.\nDocuments of Title. Besides\nsecurities in the sense of stocks\nand bonds, other valuable papers, particularly documents of\ntitle, serve as the basis of banking credit. Under widely prevailing statutes today not only bills\nof lading and warehouse receipts may easily be made negotiable by making the goods\ndeliverable to ones order, or by\notherwise following the statute,\nbut practically any thing may be\ncovered by a negotiable document of title. The Uniform Sales\nAct says: A document of title in\nwhich it is stated that the goods\nreferred to therein will be delivered to the bearer, or to the order of any person named in such\ndocument is a negotiable document of title.1 Such documents\nare particularly useful in shipping goods great distances, especially in foreign trade, where\nit is possible to attach the document representing the goods to\na draft (bill of exchange) to be\ndelivered on payment of the\ndraft, or in more complicated\ncases to attach papers representing Cost, Insurance and\nFreight (C.I.F.), exchange, collection and interest, none of which\nneed be paid for by the customer until the goods are available, while the bankers who\nmake the necessary advances\nare secured by holding the papers. Longer financing of goods\nin a warehouse is possible with\nsuch paper, which enables the\nbank to substitute the drawers\nin its safe for a lumber room, in\nthe original sense of the term,\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\non his contract leads inevitably\nto some kind of procedure\nwhereby the lien can be utilized\nto satisfy the judgment. In other\nwords, modern law provides differently in different jurisdictions\nfor some sort of foreclosure of\na possessory lien after due notice to the owner of the goods.\nGenerally a public sale is required and a strict accounting\nis expected of the surplus\nyielded by the sale over and\nabove the debt and the costs of\nprocedure. A lien of this kind is\neasily lost; for example, it is forfeited if possession is given up\nand does not revive on retaking\npossession; it is lost if the lienholder is guilty of a conversion\nof the goods, and apparently he\nis guilty of a conversion if he\nwithholds the goods from the\nowner without specifying the\nlien as his reason for withholding them.\nLien law is important in a few\nbusinesses which deal with a\nconstantly shifting traveling\npublic: carriers, innkeepers, garage-men (which take the place\nof the smiths of Blackstones\nday), and repairmen generally.\nPledges of Things; Collateral\nSecurities. The lien, with its\nmodern equipment for enforcement, closely resembles the\npledge, whether it be the pawn\nin the pawnshop or the collateral security in the vaults of a\nbank or brokerage house. There\nis a thought-provoking difference between the evolution of\nthe pawnbrokers pledge and\nthe banks. The former has been\ngoverned and standardized for\nmany years by the action of the\nstate. The latter has developed\nthrough rather one-sided contracts written by the banks and\nbrokers.

All possessory liens suffer from one great\ndefect that greatly limits their\npractical usefulness in business.\nThey withdraw the goods that\nare used as the basis for credit\nfrom use and to a great degree\nfrom the channels of commerce.\nHence, when a floor plan of\ncredit is needed, that is, a plan\nwherein the goods are to remain\non the floor of the dealer who is\nbeing financed, or any plan of\nconsumer use while the goods\nare being paid for, a title hold\nmust be given to the creditor,\ninstead of a possessory hold.\nThe prototype of title holds is\nthe real estate mortgage,\nthough its imitations, such as\nliens on real estate, chattel\nmortgages, conditional sales,\nleases with privilege of purchase, trust receipts, consignment arrangements for credit\npurposes, have deviated, at\ntimes, pretty far from type. In\nsome cases the title is actually\ntransferred; in others only an incumbrance is created.\n\n44\n\n(c) Real Estate Mortgages.\nThe real estate mortgage is in\nform a deed which conveys to\nthe creditor the property that\nserves as security for credit. At\nthe end it recites that, if the debt\nin question is paid in accordance\nwith an agreement, the deed\nshall be null and void; otherwise,\nhowever, it shall remain in full\nforce and effect. Though there\nis considerable diversity in the\ntheory of mortgages adopted by\nthe several states, no Englishspeaking jurisdiction gives literal effect to this language. It\nhas been said rightly that no\nman by the light of nature can\nunderstand an English mortgage. The reason for the obscurity lies in the very laudable efforts of equity to mitigate the\n\nrigor of the law by avoiding the\nforfeiture which the language of\na mortgage involves. Ordinarily\nthe property is worth more than\nthe amount loaned on it, and it\nwould be an unfair penalty, for\nfailing to pay the debt on a particular day, to make the entire\nproperty forever that of the\ncreditor and beyond redemption. Equity has, from an\nearly period, taken the view that\nthe true meaning of the parties\nwas that the property should\nserve as security for the payment of the debt and nothing\nelse. It has, therefore, created a\nspecial right for the delinquent\ndebtor, called an equity of redemption. This simply means\nthat even after default he can\ncome in and pay the amount he\nowes plus interest and possibly\ndamages, and thereby redeem\nhis property. If he fails to do so\nwithin a reasonable time, it is,\nof course, desirable to provide\nsome means of cutting off the\nequity of redemptionthat is to\nsay, foreclosure. The term foreclosure has been used in various jurisdictions for a large variety of procedures ranging from\nformal notices, followed by a\nlapse of time, to public sales\nwith or without judicial procedure. In general, however, the\ntendency of American law is to\nmake it unlikely that the mortgagee can make a profit out of\nthe forfeiture clause in a mortgage by giving effect to the\nsimple language of the document and converting what was\nonce a mortgage into a deed.\nPassing of Title. The diversity of the various jurisdictions\nis illustrated chiefly in the question whether the so-called condition at the end of a mortgage\nis to be looked upon as a condition precedent or a condition\nsubsequent to the passage of\ntitle from the borrower to the\nlender. In form it looks very\nmuch like a condition subsequentthat is to say, it looks as\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nwww.suspicions.info\n\nif title was intended to pass to\nthe mortgagee immediately\nupon the execution of the mortgage with the expectancy that,\nin the normal course of events,\nit would pass back to the mortgagor. And so most of the older\njurisdictionsthe Eastern\nstatesseem to hold. The opposite view, which seems to prevail in the West, is that no title\npasses until default or, according to some states, until foreclosure. The consequences of\nthis diversity of view are more\ntechnical than substantial. Thus,\nif the mortgagee is the title\nholder, the mortgagor who remains in possession is pretty\nclearly a tenant, and the legal\nrelations between the two are\nviewed accordingly. If, on the\nother hand, the mortgagor still\nhas the title, whatever he is, he\nis not a tenant, and other analogies must be resorted to in\nworking out the relative rights\nof the parties. In actual practice,\nthe difference is likely to be mitigated by the terms of the contract written into the mortgage\nwhich may state rather fully the\nclaims that each shall have\nagainst the other under every\nimaginable set of factsin other\nwords, the mortgage, like many\nother legal instruments, has\ngone through a development\nfrom status to contract.\nModern law views the mortgage as an incident to the debt\nwhich it secures, whether that\ndebt is evidenced by a promissory note or other type of document or merely existent on the\nbasis of an ordinary contract.\nConsequently, the holder of the\nmortgage generally has the option of bringing an action on the\ndebt without regard to the mortgage, or of proceeding on the\nbasis of the mortgage, or of doing both simultaneously. Of\ncourse, he is entitled to only one\nsatisfaction of his claim. If the\nmortgage property brings a surplus over and above the claim\n\n\fwords is likely to be different in\ndifferent jurisdictions, and the\npresumptions indulged in may\ndiffer to such an extent that the\ntransfer of this type of interest\nmust be looked upon as a very\ntechnical branch of conveyancing.\nIt is, of course, possible not\nmerely to convey the interest\nthat remains in a mortgagor but\nalso to mortgage itthat is to\nsay, to put a second or third\nmortgage on the property. Obviously in those jurisdictions in\nwhich the first mortgage transfers title to the mortgagee, some\nother interpretation than that of\nthe title theory is necessary to\nexplain the situation of the parties to a second mortgage. It\nbecomes very similar to the first\nmortgage in jurisdictions not\naccepting the title theory. This\ndifference between a first and\nsecond mortgage has led to\nsome curious doctrines, such as\nthat of tacking, under which it\nis possible for a first mortgagee\nto acquire a third mortgage\nwhich, by reason of his superior\nposition as a title holder, becomes a part of his interest in\nthe land, and thereby obtain priority over a strangers second\nmortgage. There is a great tendency, however, to depart from\nsuch technical theories under\nmodern statutes.\nIn the real estate mortgage,\nas in all arrangements that\nmerely encumber the title of\nproperty without affecting its\ntemporary possession, there is\ndanger that a stranger dealing\nwith the apparent owner of the\nproperty in possession might\nfind himself in competition with\nthe mortgage claimant. If the\nstrict letter of the old law is followed in such a case, the\nstranger is defeated and the\nowner of the secret lien prevails.\nCaveat emptor. The desire of the\nbusiness world to make indefeasible transactions entered into\nin the ordinary way in good faith\n\nwww.suspicions.com\n\nhas, in this case as in others already studied, been recognized\nby the law and written into the\nprovisions for registration. The\nmortgagee is expected to put\nhis mortgage on record where\nit will be found as an encumbrance upon the property by\nanyone examining the title. If he\nfails to do so his mortgage is not\nrendered invalid, but it is simply dealt with as if it were\nfraudulent so far as innocent\nstrangers are concerned. The\nregistration laws of the several\nstates differ from one another\non many important points. Thus,\nsome allow a short period for\nregistration; some give the same\neffect to actual notice or constructive notice that they give to\nregistration in saving the secret\nlien; still others make the moment of registration operate mechanically as the basis of priorities claimed under registered\ndocuments.\n(d) Chattel Mortgage. By\nanalogy to the real estate mortgage there has developed in\nmore recent times the chattel\nmortgage. In some states the\nanalogy is very close, but generally the force of business necessity, as well as the relative\nsimplicity of the law of transfer\nof interests in things, has led to\nconsiderable differences both in\nthe formality and in the operation of chattel mortgages. Thus,\nit is generally true that, instead\nof registration, the comparatively inexpensive and simple\nexpedient of filing is sufficient.\nThe actual document need not\nbe executed with the formality\nof a real estate deed, but only\nwith that of a bill of sale or similar document for the conveyance\nof an interest in personal property. On the other hand, a chattel mortgage is expected to be\ncomparatively short-lived and\nnot a part of a permanent systematic legal record of the history of the thing; hence it is\n\nSuspicions News Magazine\n\nNational Law Library Volume 4 Business Law\n\nand court costs, the debtor is\nentitled to an accounting. If, on\nthe other hand, the mortgage\nproperty brings less than the\nclaim, and the action included\nthe entire claim, a deficiency\njudgment may be given for the\nbalance.\nSince the mortgage is merely\nincidental to the debt, and since\ndebts, particularly those evidenced by negotiable instruments, are easily transferred\nby creditors, it follows that the\nlaw must provide in some way\nfor the transfer of the\nmortgagees interest. The exact\nformula in any state will depend,\nin the first instance, on whether\nthe mortgagee is looked upon\nas the holder of the title to the\nproperty in question or not. In\nany event, the tendency today\nis to simplify the process of\ntransferring the mortgagees\ninterest, or even to look upon it\nas passing, in the eyes of equity,\nalong with the debt where no\nformal transfer has taken place.\nThe mortgagors interest is likewise transferable. Great caution\nmust be exercised, however,\nthat in transferring it one does\nnot unintentionally pass to the\npurchaser of it an obligation personally to pay the entire debt.\nThat is to say, the mortgagor\nmay transfer his interest in the\nland subject to"
